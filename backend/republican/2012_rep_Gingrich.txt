I'm Newt Gingrich and I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States because I believe we can return America to hope and opportunity, to full employment, to real security, to an American energy program, to a balanced budget.I worked with President Ronald Reagan in a very difficult period. We got jobs created again, Americans proud of America, and the Soviet Union disappeared.As Speaker of the House, I worked to reform welfare, balance the budget, control spending, to cut taxes to create economic growth  unemployment came down from 5.6% to under 4. For four years we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt.We've done it before, we can do it again.I want your help because no one person from the oval office can get this done. We Americas are going to have to talk together, work together, find solutions together, and insist on imposing those solutions on those who don't want to change.There are some people who don't mind if America becomes a wreck so long as they dominate the wreckage. But you and I know better.We owe it to our children, our grandchildren, our country and frankly to ourselves. So let's get together, look reality in the face, tell the truth, make the tough choices and get the job done.There's a much better American future ahead: with more jobs, more prosperity, a better health system, longer lives, greater independent living, in a country that is decentralized under the 10th Amendment, with power once again back with the American people and way from the Washington bureaucracies.No one person can accomplish this. It can't be done from the oval office. We have to work together. We Americans have to get it done.I hope you will decide to join me. Let's work side by side. Let's get this done for ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and for our country. I hope you will come to Newt.org, see what we are trying to get done, and to join us in getting American back on the right track. Thank you for joining me here today.The Derry Medical Center is a perfect place to discuss jobs, energy, the economy and healthcare.The Derry News wrote"...the Derry Medical Center, a family practice founded 47 years ago by a Scottish doctor looking to escape a volume-based, nationalized health care system. 'Things have changed tremendously over the years and now we sort of micromanage people's lives, but we're doing a lot more for chronic disease identification and management,' said Dr. Ted Brooks, a physician at the Derry center. 'We are very concerned that that's being directly threatened by what is essentially a national health care system that we don't have any control over.'"There could be no better place to discuss the difference between locally led, doctor-patient health and healthcare and the Obamacare Washington based bureaucratic control of our lives.It is one thing to have a lot of personal health decisions decided locally by you, your doctor, and your pharmacist.It is a very different and very dangerous system if those decisions are made by a Washington bureaucrat who doesn't know you, has never seen your personal health record, and doesn't even have a medical degree.There are many outstanding examples of "localism" providing better health solutions. At the Center for Health Transformation we have spent years finding great solutions at a personal, doctor and local community level.Grand Rapids Michigan has a very effective local solution in the Spectrum Health system.As Rich Devos, the founder of Amway said, "Grand Rapids is proof health can be solved locally when it can not be solved in Washington.Similarly, the Gunderson-Lutheran system in Lacrosse, Wisconsin has a very effective end of life care program which brings patients, families and doctors together in a caring, sensitive and personal process.No Washington bureaucracy can do that.Today we have reached a moment of crisis in America. More Americans are without jobs, and for longer periods of time, than at any time in our history since the Great Depression. In 2010, more people depended on assistance from government programs than at any other time in America's history. Solving this crisis of unemployment and a growing and destructive dependence on government will require the commitment, perseverance, and hard work -- not of any one man or woman -- but of Americans from every walk of life who are united by a belief in freedom and self-government. In every arena in which Washington has overstepped its constitutional boundaries or grown too large and ineffective, we must reassert the principle that WE THE PEOPLE are the source of authority, power, wealth, and freedom in American society. To restore that relationship between the government and the governed, we must move power out of Washington and return it to the American people.The 10th amendment is the Constitutions reset mechanism and in the course of this campaign I will demonstrate why a return of power to the states and to the people based on the 10th Amendment is so urgently needed today. This means rejecting a government of We the Bureaucrats and replacing it with a government of, by, and for the American people.The choice between a Washington based Obamacare and a Tenth Amendment development of localism could not be clearer.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) is unconstitutional, unaffordable, unworkable, and stunningly unfair.ObamaCares so-called "individual mandate" is a blatantly unconstitutional and unprecedented expansion of federal power.If the federal government can coerce individualsby threat of finesto buy health insurance, there is no stopping the federal government from forcing Americans to buy any good or service.If the Supreme Court finds such coercion to be constitutional, it would mean the judicial branch has given up on limited constitutional, government. It would mean that the judges believe there is no constitutional barrier to protect the individual against the absolute and arbitrary power of the state.Thats why I have publicly supported the efforts of Attorney General Cuccinelli of Virginia in his lawsuit and the 26 attorneys-general throughout the country who have challenged the constitutionality of Obamacare. Its also why I became the first presidential candidate to sign the Independent Womens Voice Obamacare Repeal Pledge last week in Iowa.And it is why I will fight for the repeal of Obamacare until it is repealed in its entirety.Obamacare is not only unconstitutional; its design is insulting to the vision of the Founders who carefully created a government of enumerated and limited powers, not a government of unlimited and open-ended powers. The law creates one thousand, nine hundred and sixty eight separate grants of power to bureaucrats, most of them to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and her bureaucracy. It creates 159 new boards, agencies and other government entities to administer health decisions that should be up to the individual in consultation with their doctor. This unprecedented grant of discretionary power to unelected bureaucrats guarantees the rise in arbitrary and corrupted decision-making by the federal government. Indeed, we are already seeing how the American belief in the rule of law is betrayed in the implementation of Obamacare.To date, the Obama Administration has issued over one thousand waivers to exempt companies and organizations from complying with the law's expensive mandates, including Big Labor and other powerful supporters of the Democratic Party.Last week, a report emerged that showed nearly 20% of the latest round of waivers are in former House Speaker Nancy Pelosis congressional district.This process provides glaring proof of the corrupting nature of big government and why our Founders distrusted centralized power.The American people will not stand for such a corrupting, unconstitutional state of affairs.Obamacare will be repealed, as will similar programs in the states. In addition to the unconstitutional nature of individual and employer mandates, we are learning that they simply dont work. Their intractable problem is this: once you have a mandate, the government has to specify exactly what coverage must be included in insurance for it to qualify. This introduces political considerations into determining these minimum standards, guaranteeing that nothing desired by the special interests will be left out. And once the government mandates such expensive insurance, the government becomes responsible for its costs. It has to adopt expensive subsidies to help people pay for the expensive plans that it is requiring. The resulting cost to the taxpayer and strain on the budget leads the government to try and control healthcare costs by limiting health care services. The inevitable result is rationing by a nameless, faceless, unaccountable board of government bureaucrats. This has been the sad, unworkable path now being followed Governor Duval Patrick in Massachusetts and it is now the same sad unworkable path unfolding in Washington. We must either limit government or we will have government limit us.As I carry the banner in fighting for the repeal of Obamacare, I will advocate for specific replacement health policies that will create a free market framework for healthcare, provide affordable, portable, and reliable healthcare coverage, and establish a health care safety net focused on those in need. This system will assure health care for all with no individual mandate or employer mandate of any kind. This alternative to Obamacare begins with patient power and localism.Instead of an individual mandate penalty for not buying government approved health insurance, the federal tax code should be reformed to provide every American the choice of a generous tax credit or the ability to deduct the value of their health insurance up to a certain amount. The federal tax code should provide the same tax relief for the individual buying his own insurance as the employer providing health insurance to its employees.This will lower costs for individuals and families, and will make it easier for people to obtain portable insurance they can with them from job to job. If you dont like your employers insurance, you get the same tax relief if you buy the insurance of your choice. Employers should also be allowed to buy individually owned insurance for their employees, instead of non-portable, group insurance.This approach provides a foundation of equal fairness for all, rather than the favoritism and rank discrimination of the Obamacare bureaucracies and the current system.We should extend Health Savings Accounts throughout the health care system. Everyone on Medicare should be free to choose an HSA as part of their coverage if they want it. Everyone on Medicaid should be free to choose an HSA for part of their coverage. All workers should be free to use their health insurance tax credit or deduction to choose an HSA in place of their employer provided health insurance if they desire.These are a few examples of reforms that we can enact, once Obamacare is repealed, that will transform our current healthcare system into one centered on the individual, where patients and doctors have power, not Washington bureaucrats.The second step in reestablishing the constitutional relationship between government and we the people is putting Americans back to work. It starts with a simple organizing principle: Job killing policies kill jobs. We must identify job-killing policies, and then end them or replace them with job creating policies. America has faced recessions before and recovered quickly. Since World War II, recessions have lasted an average of 10 months. The longest was 16 months. But today, forty months after the recession began, unemployment is actually going back up  to 9% last month. Worse, if you count those who have stopped looking for a job or are working part time when they would prefer to work full time, the real unemployment rate is at a staggering 16%.Historically, the worse the economic downturn, the stronger is the recovery. Based on previous history, America should be enjoying the second year of a roaring economic recovery by now. Instead, while the Reagan recovery averaged 7.1% economic growth over the first 7 quarters, the current so-called recovery has produced less than half that at 2.8%, with the last quarter at a dismal 1.8%.The normal resiliency of the American economy is being held back by the destructive impact of big government. Instead of trying to create jobs with wasteful stimulus spending, we need a government that gets out of the way and allows the American people to create jobs and prosperity again.That starts with cutting taxes and cutting spending. We should continue what has worked by making the current tax rates permanent, stopping the 2013 tax increases, and by repealing Obamacare and its tax increases. Next we must make America once again the most desirable country in the world for job creating investment. To do this we need a bold series of four tax cuts. We should eliminate the capital gains tax, as many of our international competitors have done, to make American entrepreneurs more competitive and to attract billions of new investments.We should reduce Americas corporate tax rate, now the highest in the industrialized world, to 12.5%.We should allow for 100% expensing of investment in new equipment, allowing farmers, factories, doctors, hospitals and all businesses to write off all new equipment in one year. This will ensure that American workers can once again employ the most technologically advanced tools in the most advanced factories and be the most productive in the world.We should permanently end the death tax and its double taxation on the lifetime savings of Americans.We also need several pro-growth regulatory reforms that remove obstacles to job creation.We should repeal the costly, ineffective, and job killing Sarbanes Oxley Act.We should replace the job killing EPA with an Environmental Solutions Agency.Finally, we need an American energy policy that favors cheap gasoline, cheap diesel fuel, cheap natural gas, and cheap electricity. Cheap American energy will lead to more jobs, greater economic growth, and wealthier Americans. This would seem to be an all too obvious goal for the country, except for the fact that the Obama administration pursues explicit policies that lead to expensive gasoline, expensive diesel, expensive natural gas, and skyrocketing electricity costs. These anti-American energy policies are killing jobs and making us all poorer. We need an all-out effort to increase domestic oil and drilling, including the development of oil shale resources in the American West, where we have an estimated three times as much oil as Saudi Arabia.We dont have to wait years for gas prices to come down. An aggressive commitment now to develop more of our abundant oil and natural gas resources will put downward pressure on prices at the pump long before any new reserves actually come online. Thats not wishful thinking. Thats called the law of supply and demand, which takes into account today whats going to happen in the future. The combination of pro-growth tax reforms, controlled spending, a return to sound money and an American energy plan will lead to strong economic growth, a dramatic decline in unemployment, and low inflation.The return to prosperity and the reestablishment of the proper constitutional balance between government and the governed will not be an easy task. But protecting our freedoms has never been easy.The election of 2012 is the most important election of our lifetime.Down the left hand road lies a Washington bureaucracy running our lives in a corrupt system defined by politicians.Down our road lies the rebirth of freedom, the reassertion of the Constitution and the renewal of the American economy.I am running for President to change Washington decisively, reinforce obedience to the Constitution and reestablish the core principles of the Declaration of Independence. This campaign will require a team effort, with every American who believes as I do that the future of American liberty requires a recommitment to the timeless principles of our countrys founding:That every man, woman, and child is endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights.That among these rights are the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.And that government derives its only just authority from the consent of the governed: from We the People. And since we truly believe that every American is endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights  then we must be determined to go into our countrys poorest communities, whether it is in the valley, the inner city, or poor, rural areas. We must change the culture; we must change the bureaucracy; we must change the tax code; we must change the law, we must do whatever it takes to ensure that every American is truly capable of pursuing happiness, as they have been endowed by their Creator with that right.And when we show that we are truly serious about all American citizens having the right to pursue happiness, we will create such an overwhelming majority, we will be able to offer our children and grandchildren a vastly better future than the bureaucratic welfare state of dependency, coercion, and ineffectiveness we face today.Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to join you today to share some thoughts about the future of our country.We have reached a moment of crisis in America. More Americans are without jobs, and for longer periods of time, than at any time since the Great Depression.In 2010, more people depended on assistance from government programs than at any other time in America's history. Solving this crisis of unemployment and a growing and destructive dependence on government will require the commitment, perseverance, and hard work -- not of any one man or woman -- but of Americans from every walk of life who are united by a belief in freedom and self-government.

This means rejecting a government of We the Bureaucrats and replacing it with a government of, by, and for the American people.We must begin this effort in two important ways.First, by reviving the American economy and setting the conditions for explosive economic growth and job creation by cutting taxes, deregulating, creating an American energy policy, and cutting spending. And second, by reasserting the Constitution and the rule of law, which means repealing Obamacare, and reasserting the power of the people over corrupt and arbitrary decision making of government officials and unaccountable federal bureaucracies.Restoring economic growth and putting Americans back to work is actually the easier of these two tasks.It starts with a simple organizing principle: Job killing policies kill jobs. We must identify job-killing policies, and then end them or replace them with job creating policies. America has faced recessions before and recovered quickly. Since World War II, recessions have lasted an average of 10 months. The longest was 16 months.

We should continue what has worked by making the current tax rates permanent and stopping the 2013 tax increases.Next we must make America once again the most desirable country in the world for job creating investment. To do this we need a bold series of four tax cuts. We should eliminate the capital gains tax, turn the rate to zero, as some of our international competitors have done, to make American entrepreneurs more competitive and to attract billions of new investments.We should reduce America's corporate tax rate, now the highest in the industrialized world, to 12.5%.We should allow for 100% expensing of investment in new equipment, allowing farmers, factories, doctors, hospitals and all businesses to write off all new equipment in one year. This will ensure that American workers can once again employ the most technologically advanced tools in the most advanced factories and be the most productive in the world.We should permanently end the death tax and its double taxation on the lifetime savings of Americans.We also need several pro-growth regulatory reforms that remove obstacles to job creation.We should repeal the costly, ineffective, and job killing Sarbanes Oxley Act.We should repeal the Dodd-Franks bill which has crippled community banks and lending to small business.We should replace the job killing EPA with an Environmental Solutions Agency.Finally, we need an American energy policy that favors inexpensive gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. Inexpensive American energy will lead to more jobs, greater economic growth, and wealthier Americans. This would seem to be an all too obvious goal for America, the Obama administration pursues explicit policies that lead to expensive gasoline, expensive diesel, expensive natural gas, and skyrocketing electricity costs. These anti-American energy policies are killing jobs and making us all poorer. We need an all-out effort to increase domestic oil and drilling, including the development of oil shale resources in the American West, where we have an estimated three times as much oil as Saudi Arabia.We have natural gas off South Carolina which will create jobs in South Carolina and an export product for America. New jobs will grow in the Port of Charleston around natural gas just as new jobs will grow in an off shore industry-high paying, high value jobs.We don't have to wait years for gas prices to come down. An aggressive commitment now to develop more of our abundant oil and natural gas resources will put downward pressure on prices at the pump long before any new reserves actually come online.That's not wishful thinking. That's called the law of supply and demand, which takes into account today what's going to happen in the future. The combination of pro-growth tax reforms, controlled spending, a return to sound money and an American energy plan will move us toward a very dramatic job growth with low inflation, which is the best way to move towards a balanced budgetby getting people off of unemployment, off of Medicaid, off of food stamps, get them back into earning a living and paying taxes.North Dakota has sliced income and corporate tax rates and has 3% unemployment. Texas in two of the last four years created more jobs than the other 49 states combined. There is a lesson here. Low taxes, deregulation, an American energy policy, and being in favor of people who are entrepreneurs, who run small businesses, who go to work and create jobs will end the recession and create a boom in jobs.Now as I said, creating jobs and growing the economy again is not the hard part. What I have shared with you is straight from the Reagan playbook and we know it works. But what Reagan didn't have to confront, but we have to confront today  and more so the citizens of South Carolina -- is the systematic assault on the rule of law by this Administration.There is to begin the blatantly unconstitutional and unprecedented expansion of federal power by Obamacare with its so-called "individual mandate".If the federal government can coerce individualsby threat of finesto buy health insurance, then there is no stopping the federal government from forcing Americans to buy any good or service. It would mean the end of limited government as envisioned by our founders.That's why I have publicly supported the efforts of Attorney General Cuccinelli of Virginia in his lawsuit and the 26 attorneys-general throughout the country who have challenged the constitutionality of Obamacare, -- and why I will fight for the repeal of Obamacare until it is repealed in its entirety. It is the unprecedented grant of over one thousand nine hundred discretionary powers to unelected bureaucrats in the Obamacare legislation that guarantees the rise in arbitrary and corrupted decision-making by the federal government.Most of these discretionary powers are granted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and her bureaucracy. The Obamacare law also creates 159 new boards, agencies and other government entities to administer health decisions that should be instead up to the individual in consultation with their doctor. James Madison, in the Federalist Papers, underscored the importance of the rule of law, which he defined as government exercising its power in predictable and evenhanded ways, as a defense against tyranny. It's worth recalling the grievances contained in The Declaration of Independence  the very grievances that fired the fury of American patriots and justified the American Revolution. The fact that the bulk of them -- -twenty-one out of twenty-seven -- concern violations of the rule of law shows that the Founders believe the rule of law to be indispensable to a just society.The founding fathers would have immediately recognized the danger of so much arbitrary power invested in unelected bureaucrats, like we find in Obamacare.Indeed, we are already seeing how the American belief in the rule of law is betrayed in the implementation of the president's new health care regime.To date, the Obama Administration has issued over one thousand waivers to exempt companies and organizations from complying with the law's expensive mandates, including Big Labor and other powerful supporters of the Democratic Party.Last week, a report showed nearly 20% of the latest round of waivers are in former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's congressional district.This process provides glaring proof of the corrupting nature of big government and why our Founders distrusted centralized power.Here in South Carolina you are witnessing first hand and up close another glaring proof of the corrupting nature of big government and it ability to destroy jobs. I'm speaking, of course, about the effort by the Obama administration's National Labor Relations Board to stop Boeing's Dreamliner plant from opening up in Charleston.The facts are well known by everybody in South Carolina and are beginning to be known across America.South Carolina is one of the twenty-two right-to-work states in America, where workers cannot be forced to join a union.Washington state, where Boeing's main production plant is located, is a compulsory union state. The NLRB's complaint, which was made on behalf of the machinists' union in Boeing's Washington production plant, comes a full seventeen months after the company announced their choice of Charleston. Boeing has already begun construction of the new facility and has already created over 1000 jobs for South Carolina. In total, the plant is expected to create 8000 new jobs. This illegal NLRB action puts all those jobs at risk. Even Bill Gould, who was Chairman of NLRB under President Clinton, has denounced the attack on Boeing as "unprecedented." If the Obama administration's hand-picked NLRB is successful in blocking the opening of the Boeing plant in South Carolina, it won't just be South Carolina that suffers. Such a ruling would put tens of millions of future jobs in all 22 right-to-work states in jeopardy. It would make it effectively impossible for U.S. companies to choose to open new facilities in right-to-work states if they are currently located in a state that allows forced unionization.In fact, a ruling against Boeing would put jobs at risk in all fifty states by increasing the flight of capital out of our country. Many companies, if they are prevented from investing in right to work states, will simply look overseas. It wouldn't save union jobs. It would simply prevent new jobs from being created here in America.Faced with our current slow economic growth, we should be making it easier for companies and entrepreneurs to create jobs in the United States, not harder. This complaint is all the more disturbing when you learn that it is being led by the NLRB's acting General Counsel, who has not yet received confirmation from the Senate, and is only on the Board because of a recess appointment from President Obama. The President also recently used a recess appointment to get Craig Becker on the Board. Becker is so radically anti-business he could not even get approved by a Democratic Senate. Becker has previously written that the federal government should be able to control where companies choose to direct their capital and resources to give unions an advantage in labor negotiations.Obviously this bears directly on this case with Boeing. It is clear that President Obama is stacking the deck against South Carolina and other right to work states at the behest of his union allies.Your Senator, Lindsey Graham, was exactly right when he characterized the NLRB's complaint as "one of the worst examples of unelected bureaucrats doing the bidding of special interest groups that I've ever seen." This complaint is an explicit and devastating example of the Obama administration's reckless and dangerous use of the power of big government to reward its political backers. It is a textbook case of the corrupting power of big government that the founding fathers warned against that erodes the rule of law. But in a larger sense, the Obama administration's action against Boeing is even more audacious than the corrupting of our political institutions by big government. We know from the 2010 census that the South led the nation for the first time in terms of population growth, adding 14.3 million people.People are voting with their feet for better economic opportunities. And a large part of the reason for the better economic opportunities in the South is the right for workers not to be forced into a union if you don't want to be. It is the right to work.And one of the most underreported stories of the large migration to the South has been the large number of African-American moving to the South in search of economic opportunity and a better quality of life.The South is winning the future. The right to work states are winning the future. They have pursued the right policies and they are leading to the right results. There is no greater proof that these states are winning the future for their citizens than the willingness of millions of Americans to move to these states in search of a better future for themselves and their children.Boeing's move to set up operations in South Carolina follows the same logic of moving to more promising opportunities.And what the Obama administration is saying in response is that they are going to block economic progress and say no, while millions of Americans and thousands of companies are saying yes to a better life. There is no clearer example of this administration's willful disdain for the consent of the governed.The Republican House should cut off all funding for the NLRB until President Obama withdraws the nominations of Lafe Soloman and Craig Becker, and appoints replacements who pledge to uphold the rule of law instead of the rule of big labor. The return to prosperity and the reestablishment of the proper constitutional balance between government and the governed will not be an easy task. But protecting our freedoms has never been easy.The election of 2012 is the most important election of our lifetime.Down the left hand road lies a Washington bureaucracy running our lives in a corrupt system defined by politicians.Down our road lies the rebirth of freedom, the reassertion of the Constitution and the renewal of the American economy.I am running for President to change Washington decisively, reinforce obedience to the Constitution and reestablish the core principles of the Declaration of Independence. This campaign will require a team effort, with every American who believes as I do that the future of American liberty requires a recommitment to the timeless principles of our country's founding:That every man, woman, and child is endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights.That among these rights are the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.And that government derives its only just authority from the consent of the governed: from We the People.

Thank you for the opportunity to be with you this evening. It is good to be among such close friends. I have known Sheldon and Miriam for a very long time indeed, and it is wonderful to be with you both tonight.  I treasure our friendship and I salute you both for your well deserved award and recognition for all the hard work you do to keep America safe, free, and prosperous. I also wish to salute the work of the Republican Jewish Coalition.  The work that you do to champion free enterprise and America as a force for good in the world is more vital than ever. As we gather this evening, America is in the midst of an economic crisis. More Americans are without jobs, and for longer periods of time, than at any time in our history since the Great Depression. I am running for President to lead a movement of Americans who will insist on changing Washington so we can renew America. To do this, we must insist on dramatic and bold changes in Washington, repeal policies that are killing jobs and stifling growth, and enact policies that will create jobs and prosperity. There is no more important task for the next president. As someone who has been in public life for nearly forty years, I know full well the rigors of campaigning for public office. In fact, I have had some recent reminders. But I will endure the challenges and I will carry the message of American renewal to every part of this great land, no matter what it takes. A vitally important part of American renewal is renewing American leadership around the world as a force for a lasting peace, especially in the Middle East. This is why I was so happy to accept your invitation to be here tonight. Earlier this week, Jewish people all over the world celebrated the Feast of Shavuot, or Pentecost, commemorating the revelation of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. And today is actually Pentecost Sunday in the Christian tradition. It was on this Feast of Shavuot 44 years ago, in June of 1967, a mere six days after the Old City of Jerusalem had been reunited in the Six Day War, that for the first time in almost 2,000 years, Jewish people were once again able to visit the Western Wall and walk the streets of the Old City as citizens of a sovereign Jewish nation. Hours before dawn that day, thousands upon thousands of Jews gathered at the Zion gate to await entry into the Old City. At 4 a.m., the crowds were finally allowed to stream into east Jerusalem -- the first time Jews had been allowed to carry out a pilgrimage to the Western Wall, as members of a Jewish nation, celebrating a Jewish festival -- since the pilgrimages to the Temple 2,000 years earlier. As the sun rose over the Old City, a total of more than 200,000 Jews made their way through the city streets to a site that today remains the heart of a people, a religion, and a nation. Each year the Festival is celebrated in a similar fashion, by a pedestrian pilgrimage through the streets of Jerusalem to the Western Wall. It is a pilgrimage of which generations of Jews could only dream, and signifies the unbroken connection between the identity of the Jewish people and the land of Israel that has existed not for mere decades, but for thousands of years. During this last week, today's generation of Jews made a similar pilgrimage through the streets of Jerusalem, knowing that the freedom that allows them to visit their holiest sites is more endangered at this moment in history than at any time since that Shavuot morning four and a half decades ago. Indeed, both Israel and America are at a dangerous crossroads in which the survival of Israel and the safety of the United States both hang in the balance. While the United States and her allies have won important victories in the war on terrorism, it is impossible to look at the totality of the world ten years after 9/11 and conclude that we are on the winning path, or that the world is a safer place. Year after year the forces of terrorism become stronger and the claims of terrorists become more acceptable to our European allies and more powerful in the United Nations. Year after year the Iranian dictatorship, with its openly stated desire to annihilate Israel and defeat the United States moves closer to having nuclear means to do so. Year after year Hamas grows stronger in Gaza and Hezbollah grows stronger in Lebanon. Today the greatest obstacle toward achieving a real and lasting peace is not the strength of the enemy or the unwillingness of Israel to make great sacrifices for the sake of peace, but an inability on the part of the Obama Administration and certain other world leaders to tell the truth about terrorism, be honest about the publicly stated goals of our common enemies, and devise policies appropriate to an honest accounting of reality. Recall that during Congressional testimony last year, Attorney General Holder was repeatedly asked and yet could not bring himself to say that the ideology of radical Islamism plays a role in motivating Islamic terrorists to carry out their attacks. The report issued in the aftermath of the Fort Hood attack, in which Major Nidal Hassan, who carried around business cards that said warrior of Allah and shouted Allahu Akbar while opening fire on unarmed men and women, did not once mention radical Islamism. In an eerily similar incident at the Frankfurt airport earlier this year, a terrorist opened fire, yelling Allahu Akbar and killing two people. Yet the State Department spokesman, when asked if it was a terrorist attack, responded by asking: was the shooting of congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords a terrorist attack? This moral confusion, which cannot see the difference between the isolated, albeit depraved, actions of a madman, and an attack that fits into an carefully defined ideology of radical Islamist terrorism, is sadly typical of this administrations elevation of political correctness above common sense. The Obama administrations policy towards Israel has been a victim of this same dangerous confusion. In his recent State Department speech, President Obama rightly stated that Israel cannot be expected to negotiate with a terrorist organization that denies its right to exist. But he then went on in the same speech to pressure Israel to do exactly that. President Obama wants Israel to enter into negotiations with a Palestinian Authority that is now in league with the terrorist organization Hamas. The president said that applying this pressure on Israel was not the politically savvy thing for him to do, and that the safe thing to do in an election year is nothing. He is essentially telling us that he is doing the brave thing by pressuring Israel to negotiate with terrorists who want to destroy it. President Obama and his State Department should recall some basic facts. Hamas was founded as a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of Israel. Its charter openly calls for Israel's destruction and instructs its followers to kill Jews wherever they find them. Also consider these recent statements: Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas administration in the Gaza Strip commenting on May 2, 2011: QUOTE "The Jews are the most despicable and contemptible nation to crawl upon the face of the Earth." Two days later Hamas Foreign Liaisons Chief Osama Hamdan said in an interview that QUOTE "I think that we are entering the phase of the liberation of Palestine. When we talk about the liberation of Palestine, we are talking about the notion of Return: the return of the refugees to their homeland, and the return of the Israelis to the countries from which they came." Then on May 11, Hamas MP and Cleric Yunis Al-Astal said QUOTE "In just a few years, all the Zionists and the settlers will realize that their arrival in Palestine was for the purpose of the great massacre, by means of which Allah wants to relieve humanity of their evil. That was just one month ago. Hamas goes well beyond words in its effort to destroy Israel. In 2010 over 200 missiles were fired into Israel from Gaza. No country can be expected to conduct peace negotiations with a terrorist organization dedicated to its destruction, or with a Palestinian governmental authority that joins forces with such a terrorist organization. Because Hamas has not changed, an Israeli peace with Hamas is impossible. Twenty years of hopes for the modern peace process cannot change this fundamental reality. It also means that entering into peace negotiations with any organization that includes Hamas is a fools errand.  It is something that no friend of Israel should ever ask Israel to do. And let me add, I certainly hope this administration doesnt resort to the meaningless exercise of trying to artificially distinguish between the military and political wings of Hamas as a way of justifying pressure on Israel to negotiate with the latter. We understand full well that money is fungible, but ideology is constant. Hamas remains unequivocal in its aims to destroy Israel, and it itself makes no such distinction -- an approach that plays a dangerous game with the survival of Israel. In his recent speeches, President Obama also called for Israel to accept the 1967 lines as the beginning of peace negotiations. He went to great lengths to have us all believe that what he said at the State Department and later at AIPAC was no different than what other American presidents have declared as official policy. Unfortunately, thats just not true. President Obama has in fact called for a remarkable shift in U.S. policy regarding the peace process. He wants Israel to accept the indefensible lines of 1967 as the starting point of negotiations. Accepting such a proposal would be a suicidal step for Israel. Fortunately for Israel, the Presidents plan for Israel to accept the 1967 lines is an absolute non-starter with the American people. Like Israel, we are committed to seeing a peace agreement that protects Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the Jewish state. After all, it has only been under Jewish authority that religious freedom, including access to holy sites, for people of all faiths  Christian, Jewish, and Muslim  has been protected. Meanwhile, we must readily see the Presidents policies for what they are: the dangerous accommodation of Middle East dictators, and worse, the accommodation of terrorist groups like Hamas, whose ideology virulently opposes freedom, compromise, and peace, and who view such accommodation as a weakening of U.S. resolve and commitment to Israel's security. President Obamas policies represent a sharp break from the post World War II American political consensus of providing unwavering support to the State of Israel, all at the risk of Israel's destruction and increasing danger to the United States. The decision to adopt a policy of accommodation, using the political objectives and code-words of those who wish to drive Israel into the sea, affirms the administrations radicalism in its headlong flight from the legacy of U.S. Presidents from Truman to Bush -- and is leading Israel and the Western democracies toward ever increasing danger. Nowhere will this danger be shown more clearly this coming September at the United Nations General Assembly. The Palestinians have said that they will request U.N. recognition of Palestinian statehood based upon the 1967 borders. This action would violate every standing agreement the Palestinians have with Israel, including the Oslo Accords, to negotiate a final border agreement. Such a recognition would take place totally apart from any negotiation with Israel, and without the Palestinians renouncing violence or acknowledging Israel's statehood. While President Obama rightly says that the United States will vote against this unilateral action, some nations - including even some in Europe - are sending the signal that they may indeed vote for it. A vote by civilized nations in the General Assembly to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state would strengthen terrorists' belief that their commitment to violence and their unwavering rejection of Israel's right to exist has begun to produce their desired goals. President Obama and the State Department must be clear in their discussions with our Western allies, to remember the mistakes of history and to reject this unilateral action that would reward terrorist groups who refuse to abide by the basic principles of human dignity and freedom. Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, had it right when he said: "When Israel, the only country in the world whose very existence is under attack, is consistently and conspicuously singled out for condemnation, I believe we are morally obligated to take a stand." President Obamas focus on Israel as the obstacle to peace is particularly disturbing considering the existence of a true threat to the peace of the world, and that is the threat from Iran.  The Iranian dictatorship is steadily and methodically developing nuclear weapons.  All the world's diplomatic meetings and four rounds of U.N. sanctions have not slowed the Iranian dictatorship down a single day. The Iranian leader, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has been very open and explicit about his desire to wipe Israel off the map.  When you realize that only three Iranian nuclear weapons deployed against Israel would bring about the equivalent of a second Holocaust, you have to take his words seriously. Ahmadinejad is also threatening the United States. He has called for a "world without America." A goal he said is attainable. The Iranian threat is hardly new.  Mark Bowden in his book "Guests of the Ayatollah" described the 1979 seizure of the U.S. embassy and hostage taking as the first shots in Iran's war against America. For decades, America and Israel have shared a common enemy embodied in this poisonous ideology that threatens our safety, freedom, and peace. It is the same ideology that murdered Israeli athletes in 1972, that took American hostages in Iran for 444 days; that murdered Marines in their barracks in 1983; that bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, Riyadh in 1995, the Khobar towers in 1996, the U.S. embassies in 1998, and the USS Cole in 2000. Many of the terrorist groups that have carried out these and many other attacks have been supported directly by the nation of Iran. Today Iran is watching whether the United States keeps its promises with its ally Israel and how we deal with Iran's proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah. The Iranian regime will also be watching how America and our allies treat Israel at the U.N. General Assembly this September. Just earlier this week, Iran's nuclear chief announced their intention to triple their production of highly enriched uranium and to continue to install more advanced centrifuges for that purpose. Iran has also experimented with polonium and nuclear triggers, which have only one purpose to detonate a nuclear bomb. What then should America do in the face of these facts? We first need to acknowledge that 20 years of trying to negotiate peace with evil regimes and organizations dedicated to the destruction of Israel  and in many cases our own destruction  has been a failure, and the time has come to clearly and decisively take the offensive against them. This begins with a firm and consistent commitment by the United States  in the Reagan tradition  to speak plainly and truthfully about the nature of our enemies. Next, our policies must reflect the fact that there is no moral equivalency between terrorist regimes and a legitimate self-governing country that abides by the rule of law.  A foreign policy based upon this moral distinction is increasingly critical during a moment many have termed the "Arab Spring." The uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya are evidence of the fact that there are indeed millions of peace-loving Arabs who resent the brutal oppression of their leaders' dictatorships and long for a future of freedom and peace. These uprisings are tremendous opportunities for the advancement of freedom and democracy in the Middle East. At the same time these developments are fraught with danger, and bring with them the possibility that radical Islamist factions will capitalize on the upheaval and take control. Our commitment to condemning and confronting terrorism in the world must be matched by an equal commitment to affirm the efforts of oppressed Arab citizens who are taking extraordinary risks to seek true peace, freedom, and democracy. Both in the cases of the Iranian and Syrian popular uprisings, the Obama Administration's glaring silence has undermined the strength of our commitment to freedom and solidarity with those peoples who are yearning to breathe free. And every terrorist group in the world takes note of that silence  whether Hamas, Hezbollah, or terrorist regimes like Iran. There are nine specific policy proposals I would like to leave with you tonight.  1.           As a demonstration of this new resolve, the United States should move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Israel has every right as a sovereign free nation to choose its own capitol and we should respect that choice. As President, on my first day in office, I would issue an executive order directing the U.S. embassy in Israel to be moved to Jerusalem as provided for in the legislation I introduced in Congress in 1995. 2.            The United States must also refuse to participate in any talks involving terrorist organizations and cut off all direct and indirect aid to terrorists and their front groups. This must include the Palestinian Authority, so long as it includes Hamas and continues to produce propaganda lionizing suicide bombers and promoting the destruction of Israel.  We should also call on other nations who are ostensibly committed to true peace between Israel and the Palestinians to do the same. 3.            The United States should also explicitly reject the concept of a "right of return for Palestinian refugees.  The so-called right of return is a historically impossible demand that would be a demographic disaster and mean the end of a Jewish State of Israel. We are for a right to prosperity, a right to freedom, a right to the rule of law, and a right to private property.  We must be totally opposed to a right of return.    This means that the Palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside the borders of Israel by the Palestinian government after Palestinian statehood has been achieved. 4.            The United Nations camp system must be replaced with a system of earned income and property rights to restore dignity and hope to every Palestinian. The current, failed camp system of socialism and unearned charity has been a disaster. It has led to poverty, vast unemployment, deep bitterness and a society which produces entrepreneurs of terrorism rather than entrepreneurs of wealth creation. More money in the form of international aid will not solve this problem. A new approach will bring a better standard of living and greater freedom and security for Palestinians than all the terrorist efforts and dictatorships have been able to achieve. 5.            We must also re-establish the United States Information Agency as a robustly funded worldwide anti-terrorism and pro-freedom communications and advocacy system. The USIA fought for our side in the war of ideas during the Cold War and helped us win. In 1999, this agency was dismantled because we thought the war of ideas was over. We discovered on 9/11 that it was not. Israel is reminded of this on almost a daily basis. Earlier this year, terrorists of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade broke into the West Bank home of Udi and Ruth Fogel in Itamar. The terrorists stabbed this husband and wife to death. They murdered three of their children. Not even the youngest of these children, a three-month-old baby girl named Hadas, was spared. They slit the childs throat, and severed her head from her body. In Gaza, crowds handed out candy and celebrated. This sickening display of jubilation at the gruesome murder of a three-month-old child is the result of decades upon decades of brainwashing Palestinian children.  It is an example of the kind of barbaric acts of terror that must be rejected by all Palestinians in any peace negotiation with Israel. The USIA helped America win the Cold War and it can help us win the war against evil terrorist organizations and dictatorships. But to do this we must ensure that the USIA once again has independent board of governors reporting to the President and coordinating with the State Department but not controlled by the diplomats. Never again should a three-month-old baby be killed without the entire world being repulsed and joining together in condemning such terrorists and their supporters. 6.            We must aggressively confront the growing threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. The existence of the Iranian regime pursuing nuclear weapons and financing terrorism across the globe is a primary threat to the security of the United States, Israel and our allies in the world. The United States must lead the world in an all-out effort to replace the Iranian dictatorship using the diplomatic, economic, information, political, and covert tools President Reagan used to defeat and dismantle the Soviet Empire. 7.            The United States must also establish an aggressive new strategy of taking back the United Nations from the forces of terrorism and dictatorship. Totally discrediting and, if possible, stopping the Durban 3 conference on racism later this year  the previous two sessions of which have been used as a vehicle for anti-Semitism - should be an early goal of this new worldwide campaign. Furthermore, the United States must be prepared to suspend all funding to the United Nations if the General Assembly moves to recognize a Palestinian state under the control of Hamas. 8.            All of this will require a restructured State Department, a new level of training and management for Ambassadors, a new promotion system, and a profound shift in the culture of the Foreign Service.  The quickest way to change the culture at the State Department is to inject new blood into the system. We must engage in fundamental reform of the overly slow and bureaucratic security clearance system to raise the level of applicants to the Foreign Service. Change on this scale will be bitterly fought by the old guard at State and their media allies. It will require a strong, experienced, and knowledgeable Secretary of State and a deeply committed team around him. My campaign website newt.org contains a detailed document outlining the other changes that will be necessary to transform the State Department's historic aversion to moral clarity about the difference between terrorism and civilization, which have weakened both the United States and Israel. 9.            Finally, the United States must establish an American energy policy designed to strengthen our national economy and weaken our opponents in the Middle East by keeping in the United States the hundreds of billions of dollars we now spend on foreign oil supplies. We must dramatically increase American energy supplies so we can lower the marginal cost of energy worldwide. Nothing will do more to alter the strategic balance of power away from dictatorships and state sponsors of terror than a successful American energy policy. In closing, if it were possible to say a word directly to the Israeli people, it would be this: we believe together with you that peace is possible, and that peace ultimately will come to Israel. The never-ending tendency to Blame Israel First is just another variation of Blame America First, and it springs from the same weakness. It is far easier to ignore an unpleasant reality and try instead to impose your will on somebody you think you can control, rather than deal with the unpleasant reality that you are too timid to confront.  If Israel disarmed today, there would be no Israel tomorrow.  But if Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah and other terrorist groups disarmed today, then tomorrow we would have peace in the Middle East. While our challenge today will likely not meet with such a simple solution, our commitment to Israel's protection remains as staunch as it has been from the moment of Israel's birth. And I would also say this to the brave people of Israel:  Never, ever underestimate the hold that Israel has on the American heart. The American people have always believed in Israel, and we believe in Israel still. Together, we will renew our mutual commitment to freedom and justice, and we will work to achieve a peace in which war and bloodshed and violence are no longer a common feature of life for you and your children. On June 30, 1936, when Abyssinia was being invaded by Italy, Emporer Haile Selassie appealed to the League of Nations Assembly for assistance. He said: "It is us today. It will be you tomorrow." We know that if the forces of terrorism could eliminate Israel today, they would turn toward America tomorrow. That is why we must reverse the Obama Administration's dangerous policies of incoherence and accommodation and implement instead a foreign policy that is clear about the evil that we face and committed to the actions necessary to overcome it. America is still the last best hope of mankind on earth. I believe like Ronald Reagan did that the goal of U.S. foreign policy must be the promotion of peace. But that it must be a real peace where freedom can flourish and justice can prevail, not a false peace that emboldens terrorists, tyrants and murderous ideologies to extend their evil throughout the world. It is toward this possibility of real peace that America must commit itself. No other nation in the history of the world has been so inexorably tied to the fate of freedom throughout the world. The time has come to reaffirm America's commitment to freedom and the rule of law; to stand firmly and courageously against terrorism and evil organizations and dictatorships.  It is time to stand firmly with our friends. Together those of us who believe in freedom will defeat tyranny for the fourth time in a century. Together we will earn for our children and grandchildren a freer and safer world. This is our duty.  This is our generation's rendezvous with destiny. Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to join you today to share some thoughts about the future of our country. Today, more Americans are without jobs, and for longer periods of time, than at any time in our history since the Great Depression. We have seen a collapse in home prices on a scale worse than during the Great Depression. One out of every four American homes is now worth less than its mortgage. Homes in the Atlanta area are now worth no more than they were at the end of 1999.  And there are some signs home prices may continue sliding. There are nearly 45 million people  nearly one in seven Americans  currently receiving food stamps, the highest number in history. We spent $140 billion on unemployment compensation last year  again, the highest figure in history and over seven times what we were spending just a decade ago. The pain inflicted by the Obama Depression runs deep. Beyond the 14 million Americans who are "officially" unemployed, another 6 million Americans have become disillusioned and have given up looking for jobs altogether. The unemployment rate for African-American youths looking for work was a staggering 41% in May. The jobs crisis is an historic national crisis and the Obama Administration has only made it worse by pursuing job-killing policy after job killing policy. This is why I will spend every day of my campaign and then every day of my administration, if elected, working for economic policies that help create jobs, not kill them. We need to replace the "food stamp President" with a "paycheck President". I truly believe we can overcome this crisis. I believe we can create jobs and get America on the right track. But renewing America will require the commitment, perseverance, and hard work -- not of any one man or woman -- but of Americans from every walk of life who are united by a belief in freedom and self-government. Last month, I was the first presidential candidate to put forward a jobs and prosperity plan. It starts with cutting taxes, cutting spending, cutting burdensome regulations, and enacting an effective American energy policy. We must make America once again the most desirable country in the world for job creating investment.  To do this we need a bold series of four tax cuts. We should eliminate the capital gains tax and the death tax.  We should reduce Americas corporate tax rate, now the second highest in the industrialized world, to 12.5%. And we should allow for 100% expensing of investment in new equipment. We should also not raise current tax rates now, or in the future. I will block any proposed tax increases in 2013 and beyond. It makes no sense to raise taxes and kill more jobs in a deep recession. The Obama approach on energy has been to erect barriers that prevent us from taking advantage of our vast American natural resources. In the process, the price of a gallon of gas has gone up by nearly two dollars since he took office. We need an American energy policy that favors less expensive gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. We also need several pro-growth regulatory reforms that remove obstacles to job creation. This begins with repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a pro-jobs, pro-responsibility plan that focuses on Patient Power and puts doctors and patients in charge of health decisions instead of bureaucrats. The Gingrich Jobs and Prosperity Plan will be a dramatic reversal of the policies of the Obama Administration. It takes responsibility out of Washington and puts it in the hands of American entrepreneurs and consumers. You can find all the details of the Gingrich jobs and prosperity plan at newt.org. However, there is little hope that these tax and regulatory changes will sustain long-term economic growth if they are not also accompanied by a fundamental reappraisal and restructuring of the Federal Reserve and the repeal of the Dodd-Frank legislation, which are the focus of my remarks today. Let's start with the Federal Reserve. The operations of the Federal Reserve have an extraordinary impact over our everyday lives. The Fed influences how much money is circulating in the economy, the value of the dollar, and what we pay to borrow from banks in the form of interest rates. Since the enactment of legislation in 1978 known as the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Fed has had a dual mandate: maximum employment and stable prices. These two goals are incompatible. As a part of a thorough reappraisal of the role of the Federal Reserve System, Congress should immediately narrow the focus of the Fed to the sole goal of stable prices. Senator Bob Corker may have said it best when he described the Fed as having today a bipolar mandate. This means that the same policies that the Fed uses to encourage job and economic growth are also the mechanisms that most dangerously weaken the value of the dollar by promoting inflation. For example, the Fed might increase the money supply substantially in the belief that such monetary expansion will spark economic growth. But a Fed that floods the economy with new dollars in an attempt to stimulate economic growth and new jobs is a Fed that decreases the value of every dollar in every Americans pocket through higher inflation, making every American poorer. Look at what has already happened. Today we have a dollar that is stunningly weaker than it used to be, and the price of everything from gasoline to groceries is steadily drifting upward. A dollar in 2011 only buys what 76 cents did in 2000. The Euro and Dollar were at parity in January 2000  today, the Dollar only buys 70 Euro cents. Thats right: Even as the Greek economy crumbles, threatening a domino effect across southern Europe, the Euro is still worth nearly 150 percent of the dollar. Historically low interest rates made possible by Fed policies over the past decade fueled an inflationary housing bubble.  Home prices exploded due in part to the availability of cheap credit only to collapse disastrously in 2006 and 2007. As a result, the average Americans home is worth no more than it was a decade ago. The Feds dual mandate also negatively affects job creation.  To put it briefly, we will never be able to achieve sustainable long-term job creation in this country if the Fed continues to artificially affect the level of interest rates. Artificial interest rates distort investment decisions all across the economy, resulting in a misallocation of productive resources that cannot be sustained over the long term.  Eventually, artificially low rates lead to an economic bust and widespread job losses.  Only when interest rates are no longer manipulated can businesses and entrepreneurs determine the right investments that can in turn lead to sustainable job creation throughout the economy. ***** During the 2008 financial crisis, the powers of the Federal Reserve took center stage. In the heat of the crisis, the Fed made thousands of emergency loans to banks and other large institutions for reasons that are not entirely clear. These loans totaled at least three trillion dollars. At the time, all of this money was lent out with complete secrecy, with no oversight from our elected representatives in Congress. We are only beginning to learn about the true nature and scope of the lending. What we are discovering is shocking and infuriating. If that were not bad enough, Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke then spent the next two years fighting to make sure the American people did not know who actually received any of this money. Now, thanks in part to a tenacious effort by Bloomberg and the Fox Business Channel, along with committed legislators, the Fed has begrudgingly made two rounds of disclosures about who got the money and how much between 2007 and 2010. The truth is shocking. For example, between 2008 and 2010, the Fed extended dozens of loans, totaling at least five billion dollars, to the Arab Banking Corporation. A major shareholder of the Arab Banking Corporation is the Central Bank of Libya, which is controlled by Muammar Gaddafis regime. Other examples show that while the Treasury was bailing out the American auto industry, the Fed was busy purchasing securities from foreign competitors, including German firms BMW and Volkswagen, and Japanese firms Toyota and Honda. It is a fact that the Fed also purchased hundreds of billions of dollars worth of securities from foreign banks, including Germanys Deutsche Bank and Switzerlands Credit Suisse. And during this time the Fed extended billions of dollars in commercial credit to American corporate giants, such as General Electric, Verizon, Caterpillar, and McDonalds, in late 2008 and early 2009. With so much activity going on behind the closed doors of the Federal Reserve in Washington and New York, we must undertake a full-scale and comprehensive audit of the Federal Reserve. We should never again have to go to court and beg to find out what actions the politicians and bureaucrats are doing that risk depreciating the dollar and exposing the taxpayer to enormous losses. It is our right to know now who got the money and why. A few bold measures by Congress and media outlets have begun to shed light on exactly what happened during the crisis, but we deserve the whole story. A comprehensive audit of the Federal Reserve and a narrowing of its statutory mandate should only be the beginning of reassessing the role of the Federal Reserve. Decisions by unelected and largely unaccountable Federal Reserve bureaucrats naturally leave Americans feeling outraged and helpless, especially when these decisions have as a consequence the debasing of our currency and the bailing out of favored interests. Unfortunately, this idea that we would want a dramatically more limited Federal Reserve is not very popular in Washington. And let me say in this regard that there is no elected official who has done a greater job of bringing to public attention the very serious problems raised by the operations of the Federal Reserve than Texas Congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for focusing our attention on the very real erosion of American freedom and prosperity caused by the actions of the Federal Reserve. ******** The second subject of my remarks today concerns the legislation known as Dodd-Frank. I believe that the Dodd-Frank legislation is the most destructive assault on businesses in a decade. This legislation positively discriminates against independent and community banks and buries them under a blizzard of red tape and regulations, making it hard for them to survive. Yet, independent and community banks are the very lifelines to American small businesses, which are themselves the engines of American job creation.  These independent and community banks support over half of the small business loans made in America. Fewer independent and community banks means fewer small business loans, which means fewer jobs and rising unemployment. It is a job killing equation that that authors of Dodd-Frank apparently never bothered to evaluate. Because Dodd-Frank is legislation that kills jobs, it must be repealed. It is yet another example of the Left overreacting to a crisis by allocating massive new regulatory powers to bureaucrats  the same bureaucrats who claimed to have been in control immediately prior to the crisis. We saw this same faith in bureaucracy phenomenon in 2002 with the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which placed prohibitively expensive compliance burdens on publicly traded firms and eroded American competitiveness and which is still killing jobs today. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Dodd-Frank contains 259 mandated rulemakings, another 188 suggested rulemakings, and provides for 63 reports and 59 studies. Dodd-Frank harms small independent and community banks in two principal ways. First, it creates two classes of banks. Big banks that have the backing of the federal government, and small banks that do not. Dodd-Franks proponents claim that it ends too big to failthe practice of the government guaranteeing that it will use taxpayer dollars to save a failing bank, so long as it is big enough. However, the government will be giving special attention to the big banks that it deems to be systemically important. As my former colleague at the American Enterprise Institute Peter Wallison points out, these big banks may be scrutinized more heavily than others, but they will also have implicit guarantees for government support that others will not have. The [Dodd-Frank] DFA changes the competitive environment for financial services in the United States by providing for different regulation of large firms than small ones. In effect, the firms that are designated as systemically important have been declared too big to fail. While the act also provides that these firms cannot be bailed out in the event of their failure or financial distress, it gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation enough authority and discretion to save most if not all of their creditors from losses in the event of their failure. This, together with the fact that these firms will be specially regulated by the Fed, will create moral hazard; the creditors of these companies will believe that they face lower risks of loss than the creditors of other companies. For this reason, the companies designated as systemically important will likely have a lower cost of funds than their smaller competitors and thus an unfair competitive advantage that will suppress competition from smaller firms.  With government backing, these big banks will have substantial competitive advantages over their smaller competitors who will be left to fend for themselves. Major investors will put their money in government guaranteed too big to fail banks and avoid small independent banks which will be starved of major depositors. Second, Dodd-Frank will create staggering new costs that banks will have to pay in order to comply with all of the new regulations. As with any new regulatory burden, smaller institutions are at a severe disadvantage compared to larger institutions when it comes to compliance. Goldman Sachs will be able to hire 100 lawyers in order to comply with new rules without much of a problem. But for smaller banks that serve communities, even bringing in one new employee to deal with compliance could make the difference between turning a profit and going out of business. Community banks have been urged to keep substantially more capital on hand in order to pay for the new regulations in Dodd-Frank. They have been told that they may have to merge or else risk shutting down completely. This would be a tragedy, and devastating for anyone who wants to start or expand a small business and create jobs for the 14 million Americans currently unemployed. And the bureaucratic rulemaking goes on. Regulators are now considering a rule arising from Dodd-Frank that would penalize banks for making home loans to anyone except borrowers willing to put a 20 percent down payment on a new home. Such a proposed rule reflects a fundamentally misguided worldview that prevails in Washington: that bureaucracies know best; that bureaucracies are capable of effective central economic planning; that bureaucracies and their rulemaking are superior to the prices and practices that arises from the give and take of a free market. When we have a greater home price reduction than in the Great Depression does it make any sense to make it even harder to buy a house thus further depressing housing values? When one out of every four American homes is worth less than its mortgage does it make any sense for our government to make a housing revival even more difficult and even further away? Of course not. Two major steps toward a recovery in jobs and housing values are clear. First, repeal the Dodd-Frank law immediately. Second, audit and reform the Federal Reserve system. These are actions Washington can take to clear the path to creating jobs and raising home values. These are actions we should all demand that Washington take NOW. Thank you. You know, you're here at a historic moment. I think this is the first time in American history that two Georgians running for president have been back to back talking to an audience. [laughter and applause] I was just—I was just comparing notes with Herman offstage. I don't know if you've watched it, but the elite media said several weeks ago this was now a two-person race. And Herman and I have decided that may be right, but they have the wrong two people. [cheers, laughter, and applause]And it is kind of interesting that the two guys who have gotten the most money have lost the most votes, and the two guys who had the most ideas have gained the most votes. And that might—I don't want to be too optimistic, but that might convince the elite media that maybe there is more to politics than fundraising and consultants, and maybe having a heart and a brain actually matters a lot. [cheers and applause]Now, I think we are in a period of enormous challenge. I think that part of that challenge is Barack Obama, but frankly, I think it's much deeper. We have bureaucracies out of control. We have judges who don't understand the Constitution. We have teachers who don't believe in American history. We have an academic class that is in many ways alienated from the American people and an elite media which, frankly, I think, has no understanding of the origins of the United States and the nature of American civilization.So we have a lot of work to do. Recently I released—and you can see it at newt.org—a contract—21st century "Contract with America." And it outlines the scale of change. It outlines both a legislative program, and it outlines a first-day program of very specific executive orders.Now, let me you give an example. Imagine about 3:30 or 3:45 on inauguration day, the inaugural address is over. We've said goodbye to folks. We take about an hour and a half, and we start signing between 50 and 200 specific orders moving the government away from Obama and back towards the American tradition. [cheers and applause]Now I don't—you can go to newt.org and you'll see a section—and this is open to you—we will release all the executive orders by October the 1st next year, so it will all be a part of the closing month of the campaign. And if the president says he's for one of them, we'll print it out, he can sign it. [laughter]But—but I can—I don't know what all of them will be, but I can tell you what the first one will be. Around 3:45 or 4:00 on the afternoon of the inauguration, about the time that President Obama gets to Andrews Air Force Base to get on Air Force One to go back to Chicago—[cheers and applause]—I will sign executive order number one, which will abolish as of that moment every White House czar. [cheers and applause]Now, I wanted to come today to talk about a historic crisis that only indirectly relates to the president. You know, Abraham Lincoln said, if you debate somebody who does not agree that two plus two equals four, you probably can't win the argument because facts make no difference. And I want to start with that example.Imagine that by a 5-to-4 vote the Supreme Court decided that two plus two equals five. Under the current theory which the Warren court promulgated in 1958, the only effective recourse would be either, A, to get a future Supreme Court to reverse them, or B, to pass a constitutional amendment declaring that two plus two equals four.Now I want you to think about the absurdity of this. I mean, do any of you seriously believe that five appointed lawyers decided two plus two equals five, that the rest of us would promptly change our school textbooks, change our accounting systems? I mean, some people may. That could well explain Obama's budgeting system.But—[laughter]—but obviously this is absurd. It can't possibly be true that the Founding Fathers wrote into the Constitution a very elaborate, complex process of amending the Constitution and said, however, that if the Supreme Court is split 4-to-4 between liberals and conservatives, and Justice Kennedy gets up in the morning, he becomes a one-person Constitutional Convention. If he gets up and he feels conservative that day, it must be a conservative Constitution. If he gets up and he feels liberal that day, it must be a—this is an absurdity foisted on us in 1958 by a historic lie. There is no judicial supremacy. It does not exist in the American Constitution. [cheers and applause]Let me be clear. Judicial supremacy is factually wrong, it is morally wrong, and it is an affront to the American system of self-government. [cheers and applause] One of the major reasons that I am running for president of the United States is the 9th Circuit Court decision in 2002 that one nation under God, in the Pledge of Allegiance, was unconstitutional. That decision to me had the same effect that the Dred Scott decision extending slavery to the whole country had on Abraham Lincoln, because I thought, if an American appeals court could be so radically out of touch with America that it could seek to block children from saying one nation under God as part of their description of America, that we had come to a point when we needed a constitutional crisis to reassert the legislative and executive branches' legitimate prerogatives to teach the judiciary that they cannot be anti-American and expect us to tolerate them radically changing our society by judicial dictate. [cheers and applause]Now, what I'm saying to you is in the best tradition of the American Revolution. Read the Declaration of Independence. A very large number of its specific charges against Great Britain involve dictatorial judges. The fact is, the Founding Fathers deeply distrusted judges and thought that the lawyer class was dangerous and that you could not give them unbridled power or they would undermine and destroy free society. [applause]AUDIENCE MEMBER: Correct! Right!MR. GINGRICH: Now, this is not some marginal position. Thomas Jefferson, asked about judicial supremacy, said that is an absurdity; that would be an oligarchy.And so I think we are faced at one of the great crossroads of American life. And it's doubly dangerous because, you see, if judges think that they are unchallengeable, they are inevitably corrupted—corrupted in a moral sense. I don't mean taking money. But I mean in a sense of arrogance, in a sense of imposing on the rest of us, whether it's one judge in California deciding he knows more than 8 million Californians about the definition of marriage—[applause]—whether it's a judge in San Antonio who rules that not only can schoolchildren not say a prayer at their graduation, they cannot use the word "benediction," they cannot use the word "invocation," they cannot use the word "God," they cannot ask the audience to stand, and if they do any of these things, he will lock up their superintendent.Now, the idea of an American judge becoming a dictator of words is so alien to our traditions and such a violation of our Constitution, as I will explain in a moment, that that particular judge should be removed from office summarily. [cheers and applause]Lord Acton warned in the 19th century that power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Notice he dropped the word "tends." And the courts in the last 53 years have proven that Lord Acton is right because with each passing decade, the judges have become more hostile to the American tradition. They now openly talk about using foreign sources of information because, after all, the American Constitution is so old and so antiquated. A justice who believes that shouldn't be serving on the American bench. [cheers and applause]We have a very lengthy paper, the work of years of—of—of effort by a number of us, edited by Vince Haley, which we have published this afternoon at newt.org, which outlines step by step how fundamentally profoundly ignorantly anti-American the current judicial model is that is taught in virtually every law school in this country. It is profoundly wrong. And as Steve King has pointed out, one of the major impediments and threats to democracy today is the very behavior of the law schools, which teach a usurpation of power in a way that is utterly unsustainable.The Founding Fathers designed our Constitution based on Montesquieu's concept of the balance of power. We're supposed to have three co-equal branches. There can be no supremacy if there are three co-equal branches, by definition. Otherwise, you'd have a superior branch and two inferior branches.But it's worse than that. If you read Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, he says the courts couldn't possibly take on the legislative and executive branch because they would inevitably lose. And what did he mean by that? This is, I think, one of the most important things we will explore over the next year.And because this is a more complicated topic than a 30-second answer during a game-show version of a presidential debate—[laughter, cheers, and applause]—as the Republican nominee, I will, in my acceptance speech, challenge the president to seven Lincoln-Douglas-style three-hour debates with a timekeeper and no moderator. [cheers and applause] One of those debates should be on the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Federalist Papers and the nature of the American judiciary. [cheers and applause]Jefferson is the most clear example of taking on the judiciary. In the Judicial Reform Act of 1802, the Jeffersonians eliminated 18 out of 35 federal judges—didn't impeach them, just abolished their offices—told them to go home. [cheers and applause] Now, I'm not—let me be clear: I am not as bold as Jefferson.AUDIENCE MEMBER: No.MR. GINGRICH: I think the judge in San Antonio would be an important initial signal, and I think the 9th Circuit Court should be served notice—[cheers and applause]—that it runs the risk of ceasing to exist.Jackson in—in tackling the Bank of the United States, which he said was a(n) overly centralized form of power—think of it as the earlier Bernanke—was told, well, the Supreme Court has said that it's constitutional. He said: Fine, that's their opinion. [laughter] And he said: I have a different opinion. I am the president. They're a court. They get their opinion in court. I get my opinion in the White House.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right.MR. GINGRICH: Lincoln spends the—a large section of his first Inaugural Address explaining with the Dred Scott decision may be the law of the case, but cannot be the law of the land, and Lincoln refuses to enforce the Dred Scott decision while he's president, period.So people who come in and say, oh, as Nancy Pelosi once said, if the court speaks, it's as though God has spoken. [laughter] Now be fair. Having somebody from her branch of the party recognize God is an important step in the right direction. [laughter and applause]On the issue of God in American public life, a country created because we are endowed by our Creator AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!MR. GINGRICH:—the courts have been historically wrong at least since the late 1940s and have gotten worse and worse, more and more anti-religious, more and more secular, and more and more hostile.And the question of national security—in the last few years, the courts, I think, have become virtually out of touch with reality. The idea that the courts are now going to take on responsibility for defending the United States is a clear and fundamental violation of the Constitution and a fundamental violation of the executive branch's power, and the Congress should pass a law repudiating every interference of the courts in national security issues and returning them to the Congress and the president, where they rightly belong. [applause]On abortion, the courts are wavering all over the place. They start with a clear and definitively stupid decision over here, and they've modified it at least twice since then. They don't know what they're doing. The fact is, Robbie George of Princeton may be right and we should explore very seriously whether we could use the 14th Amendment to define life in a congressional statute and insist that that be in fact the law of the land. And I think it's something we should look at very, very seriously. [cheers and applause]On marriage, it should be quite clear, on issues like the Defense of Marriage Act, that we should simply say it can't be appealed, as it simply—you—it's very clear in the Constitution. The Congress can decide what can be appealed. The Congress can exclude things from going to the court. In the Judicial Reform Act of 1802, they refused to let the Supreme Court hear about it for 14 months, until they'd finished wiping out all the judges. [laughter and applause] They said—they said: We want to establish a fact on the ground before you get to hear it. So this is clearly written in the Constitution.Now I said—I mentioned Jefferson, but there are other steps you could take that—that are far short of wiping out half the judges. One, you can hold hearings. I—I think for the Congress to bring in Judge Berry from San—San Antonio and say to him, explain to us your rationale AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah. [applause]MR. GINGRICH:—by what right will you dictate speech to the American people? How can you possibly take your court order and the First Amendment and tell us that this is about free speech? Just—judges who knew that when they were radically wrong they'd be hauled in front of Congress would immediately have a sobering effect about how much power they have.Second—[applause]—presidents can follow the precedent of Lincoln. I would instruct the national security officials in a Gingrich administration to ignore the recent decisions of the Supreme Court on national security matters, and I would interpose the presidency in saying, as the commander in chief, we will not enforce this. And by the way, for our liberal friends, the source of that is Franklin Delano Roosevelt. [applause]In 1942 a group of German saboteurs were landed in Florida and Long Island. They were all picked up within two weeks. Roosevelt brought in his attorney general and said: They will be tried in a military court, they will be executed, it should happen within three weeks, and tell the Supreme Court if they issue a writ of habeas corpus, I will not honor, and therefore they should not issue it. I am the commander in chief in wartime. They aren't. [applause]Congress has the power to limit the appeals, as I mentioned earlier. Congress can cut budgets. Congress can say: All right, in the future, the Ninth Circuit can meet, but it will have no clerks. [laughter] By the way, we aren't going to pay the electric bill for two years. [laughter] And since you seem to be—since you seem to be rendering justice in the dark, you don't seem to need your law library, either. [laughter]This is, by the way—I am paraphrasing Hamilton in "The Federalist Papers," in which he is defending—he says flatly, the judiciary's the weakest of the three branches. I mean, this modern model is just totally opposite the American tradition. [applause]Obviously, I'm only outlining for you item nine of the legislative part of the 21st-century Contract With America. And yet you can tell just from this, I mean, the struggle we're going to have with the lawyer class over shrinking their power and their dreams of being the people who dictate to America how we should behave—just in that one zone, imagine how big this conflict is, and then you have other zones. How do we create jobs? How do we get the National Labor Relations Board under control so it's not attacking Boeing and other job creators? How do we replace the Environmental Protection Agency with an environmental security—with an environmental solutions agency that has common sense, cooperation, takes into account the economy?I mean, step after step of things that really matter: How do we control the border by January 1 of 2014? Which you can do, by the way. You pass a law very early in 2013 that says: We are suspending any regulation or law which would inhibit us from the National Security Act of securing our border—no environmental impact statement, no confusion; get it done now. [cheers and applause]Each of these steps will be met with substantial resistance by the reactionary forces who had dreams of creating a radically different America. And each of these steps has to win, if we're going to give our children and grandchildren the free, safe and prosperous country that our children and grandchildren—that our parents and our grandparents gave us.I came here today because I think this is going to be a tremendous struggle. I did not come here today to ask you to be for me, because if you're for me, you're going to vote and go home and say: I sure hope Newt does it. And I can't; no one person can do this. Under our Constitution, the president can lead the American people in educating the Congress, in changing things. If we shrink the power of Washington by applying the Tenth Amendment, we have to grow citizens back home to fill the vacuum. [cheers and applause]So I came today to take this opportunity to outline for you one of the great historic decisions we will make over the next few years: whether we take back the courts, we rebalance the Constitution, we insist on judges who understand the Constitution. And I can promise you, in a Gingrich administration, only people who are dedicated to the original document and its original meaning will get any court appointment at any level. [cheers and applause]So let me just close and say to all of you I am here to ask you to be with me, to ask you to be with me for eight years, to ask you to stand side by side to make sure that we once again reclaim America from the forces of socialism, from the forces of class warfare, from the forces of secularism, from the forces who would let—try to get us to not teach our children about the history of this great country.If you will be with me, together we will decisively defeat Barack Obama, we will defeat the Democrats in the Senate, and over the next few years, we will decisively reclaim America as the land of the free and the home of the brave.Thank you. Good luck, and God bless you. [cheers and applause] Well, thank you, Linda. And I want to thank Linda Upmeyer is the majority leader in the house, and Greg Ganske, my former colleague in the Congress, who really all summer held this together, when really it could have fallen apart.I want to thank everybody who worked all fall, particularly during the avalanche of negative ads. Calista and I want to thank the people of Iowa. All through being drowned in negativity, everywhere we went, people were positive, they were receptive, they were willing to ask questions, and they would listen. And they really wanted to get to the truth rather than the latest 30-second distortion. And it really gave us a feeling that this process does work.I am delighted to be here tonight, and I think that we are at the beginning of an extraordinarily important campaign.The ultimate goal of this campaign has to be to replace Barack Obama and get America back on the right track. But let's be clear, one of the things that became obvious in the last few weeks in Iowa is that there will be a great debate in the Republican Party before we are prepared to have a great debate with Barack Obama. And I think it's very important to understand that.And I want to take just a minute and congratulate a good friend of ours, somebody who we admire and whose family we admire, and that's Rick Santorum. He waged a great, positive campaign. I served with Rick. We've had a great relationship over the years, and I admire the courage, the discipline, the way he focused. And I also admire how positive he was. I wish I could say that for all the candidates.But here's the key thing to ask. It's not just about beating Obama, as important as that is. It's about what do we need to do as a country to get back on the right track. And that's a lot bigger than just replacing one person in the White House.That's fixing the Congress, fixing the bureaucracy, fixing the courts, resetting the culture, getting the judges to understand that they operate within the constitution, not above it. There are tremendous steps we have to take. And we have to re-establish the work ethic and recognize we want to reward work, not redistribution; that we want to reward paychecks, not food stamps. And this is going to be a very important national conversation.But it's not just about here at home. We also have to understand, and this will be a major debate with Congressman Paul, who's had a very good night, and I congratulate him on having done very well. But the fact is, his views on foreign policy, I think, are stunningly dangerous for the survival of the United States.And I think it's a very simple question, which I would be glad at the next debate to ask Congressman Paul. If you have a terrorist who is prepared to put on a bomb and wear it as a vest and walk into a grocery store or a mall or a bus and blow themselves up, as long as they can kill you, why would you think that if they could get access to a nuclear weapon they wouldn't use it? An Iranian nuclear weapon is one of the most frightening things we have to confront for the future of every young person up here and every young person out there. If they are going to live in safety, they have to live in a world in which there is no Iranian nuclear weapon, period.So, on that front we'll have a very important debate. Is the world dangerous and do we need to be strong enough to protect ourselves or is the world really safe and is it just the Americans who are confused?I have no doubt about 9/11. It was bad people trying to kill us. It wasn't Americans. I have no doubt about the Iranians, and I have no doubt about the importance of the survival of Israel as a moral cause, which we have to recognize as central to our future.So we'll have a great debate with Congressman Paul. And it's important for setting a new stable foreign policy for the 21st century.We'll have one other great debate. And that is whether this party wants a Reagan Conservative who helped change Washington in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan and helped change Washington in the 1990s as Speaker of the House. Somebody who is into changing Washington, or do we want a Massachusetts moderate who, in fact, will be pretty good at managing the decay, but has given no evidence in his years in Massachusetts of any ability to change the culture or change the political structure or change the government.Let me be clear and I think it's important given all the things that were done in this state over the last few weeks. We are not going to go out and run nasty ads. We're not going to go out and run 30-second gut shots. We're not — but I do reserve the right to tell the truth. And if the truth seems negative, that may be more a comment on his record than it is on politics.So this is going to be a debate that begins tomorrow morning in New Hampshire, and will go on for a few months. And I'm convinced that the Republican Party will pick an heir of Reagan, a committed conservative, and somebody with a track record of changing Washington.I want to say two last things. And I think Calista will join me in both of these. The first is — and here I think you'll find Rick Santorum saying the same thing — my dad was a career soldier for 27 years. I would not have survived in this campaign against millions and millions of dollars of negative advertising if it weren't for the thousands of volunteers who showed up and who helped us in every town and in every precinct. People went out because they cared.There's someone up here who actually drove in from Indianapolis around Thanksgiving and said, "I'm staying." And someone else who brought three children and drove up from Texas and said, "I'm staying." We had people who wanted to get America back on the right track. They weren't millionaires, they weren't from Wall Street, they didn't have a super PAC, but they had courage, they had work, they were smart, and together we survived, I think, the biggest onslaught in the history of the Iowa primary and we set the stage.Now I want to say one last thing. We were over earlier tonight in Waterloo, which had the largest single site for caucusing, and a very distant relative, like 190 years, named Craig Gingrich, who came from Pennsylvania where his great-great-great-grandfather came from, spoke for me. And he was very kind, he's gotten to know our younger daughter, Jacqui, and he sent to her what he was going to say.And part of what he said to his caucus was about his two sons, who had just come back from serving in the Middle East. And it reminded me. And I would like to close with this because I think it's so important. It's why the Iowa experience and the New Hampshire experience, the places where you actually have to see people, you can't just buy TV ads or use robo calls, but in the end it's people.This process is what they risk their lives to preserve. This process of people coming together, sharing values, sharing fears and dreams, finding a way to come and get it to work, unlike the current total mess in Washington, which I believe, frankly, is a bipartisan mess.Unlike the current mess in Washington, the American system over time works when the American people roll up their sleeves to make it work. And every one of us need to remember — it's part of what made these negative ads so shameful — every one of us should remember this process survives because young men and women risk their lives to allow us to do this. We should act worthy of them.Thank you. Good luck and God bless you. On to New Hampshire. I want to thank each and every one of you. I also want to thank all of the people around the state of New Hampshire who were so warm and so generous to Callista, to Kathy, and to Jackie, and me everywhere we went. It was remarkable how many people were positive and how many people were actively supportive and helpful. And I'm delighted to have this chance to spend time and learn more about the key concerns here.And I want to thank everybody here who has been helpful to us, particularly Speaker O'Brien, who just did a great job, and Laurie Sanborn, who has been tremendous. [applause] One of the great virtues of running is that everywhere you go, you learn something. You pick up a better understanding of America. And I have to say that the leadership that Speaker O'Brien and the House showed in developing a brand new approach that I hope will be adopted everywhere in America, where they actually has the Ways and Means Committee report first and it indicated how much money they would have. And they then actually adopted a budget to fit their income, which is the opposite of every state that I know of in the country, which writes a budget and then tries to go find more of your money to fill in what they think they need. And the result was a very courageous and a very serious effort in which they cut 11% out of spending, which is a remarkable achievement, which if accomplished in Washington would begin to move us back on the right track. So speaker, I really commend you for the leadership. [applause]This is step two of a long process. And having been both a historian and I've been active a long time, you learn certain things. So let me put in context where we are.We have an opportunity, I think, to unify the country around a message of jobs, economic growth, and very dramatic programs. That opportunity is to reach out to everybody of every background who would rather have paychecks than food stamps. To convince them what Ronald Reagan did in the 1980s in creating millions of new jobs, what we did when I was speaker in the 1990s in creating millions of new jobs, can be done again.This campaign is going to go on to South Carolina. [applause]And we're going to offer the American people something very different. We're going to offer them an opportunity to participate in a very dramatic, very fundamental change in Washington, D.C. And we're going to prove that I both understand the principles and I understand the practice. I learned a lot of those principles from Ronald Reagan and from Margaret Thatcher. I got to practice them as a junior congressman working with President Reagan. I got to practice them as speaker working with Bill Clinton.And I want to suggest to you when Ronald Reagan was president, we had to find ways to get votes through the House despite the fact that Tip O'Neill was speaker. When I was speaker, we had to find a way to get bills signed despite the fact that Bill Clinton was president. I believe if we had a Republican House, a Republican Senate, and a Gingrich presidency, it would be amazing how much we could get done and how rapidly we'll get it done. [applause] So we're going to South Carolina tonight and kick off tomorrow morning a campaign for jobs and economic growth, a campaign for a balanced budget, a campaign for returning power to the states  the 10th amendment, a campaign for a strong national security, a campaign for a stable, solid Social Security program both for people now on it and for the young people who are here who deserve a chance in their lifetime to have an even better program with an even greater return.Because if we are smart, we can do better things for people.The Washington alternative  how do we raise taxes and cut spending in a way that causes you pain on the spending side and causes you pain on the tax side  is exactly backwards.I was really shocked  this is part of learning. When we had a debate the other day and we were asked a question about LIHEAP, the heating assistance program. It was phrased in a perfectly Washington way. Are you going to run a bigger deficit so you can help more people or are you going to cut people off and hurt them so you can shrink the deficit? Nobody on the panel asking the question seem to consider an alternative. What if we simply went out and developed American oil and gas, brought down the cost of heating oil, and didn't need to help people because the price came down? [applause] That idea of doing more and doing it better does not exist in Washington lexicon. And it makes it so hard for our news media friends to cover because it's so strange. [laughter] What if you're just innovative? What if you just have new approaches? What if you just did everything Americans have always done?The fact is the entrepreneurial free enterprise system, which attracted people from Benjamin Franklin to the Wright brothers to Henry Ford, to Thomas Edison, to Bill Gates, to Steve Jobs. That model of maximizing the development of new approaches, new energy, new opportunities, new technology has raised the standard of living of people across this planet more than any other system in the history of the world. [applause] With your help... [applause]You've been wonderful to us here. And I'm asking each of you not to slow down. In the next couple of days, make a list of every person you know in South Carolina and every person you know in Florida 'cause those are the next two great contests.And I believe as we get to South Carolina, as the choice becomes clear, as people understand that there is a bold Reagan conservative Republican approach of lower taxes, less regulations, more American energy, a sound dollar, and actually being in favor of creating jobs  the opposite of the Obama program of higher taxes, more regulations, less American energy, and attacking the people who created jobs. Look at those two models. I believe we can reach out and we can create a majority that will shock the country and a majority that will begin to put us back in the right track. It is doable. It is a daunting challenge. But consider the alternatives.If we do not go the extra mile and we do not offer a vision powerful enough to unify Americans and we continue down the road that Obama has us on. But more than Obama  the bureaucracy that has us on, the judges have us on, the entire pattern of how Washington operates has us on. More years of decay, more years of inadequacy, more years of falling behind, more years of growing weakness. That's the alternative.I believe that it will take someone who is capable of debating Barack Obama face-to-face, delivering the conservative message, winning the argument in order to overcome his billion-dollar machine. With your help, as your spokesperson representing your values on behalf of our children, our grandchildren, and our country, I will do everything I can to win the opportunity to represent you this fall in debating and defeating Barack Obama.Thank you. Good luck, and God bless you. Let me first of all say thank you to everyone in South Carolina who decided to be with us in changing Washington.Calista and I are particularly happy to have our daughters, our son- in-laws, my two chief debate coaches, Maggie and Robert, who are both right here. And we're delighted to have - my sisters are here, Robbie and Susan, just terrific.I also want to recognize several people who were just extraordinarily important in South Carolina making this happen. Judge Billy and Deborah Wilkins just really took over and did a great job. My former colleague, former Congressman John Nappier is such a terrific class act. He did such a class act statewide putting things together.House Majority Leader Kenny Bingam came on board and really helped us with the statewide network. Speaker Bobby Harrell was tremendous. We traveled the last several days together. Andre Bauer made a big difference. Vivian Wong was tremendous in helping us all across the state. Peter McCoy was remarkable.And finally I just want to say we had a team on our staff who worked endless hours week after week. They did a great, great job. There are so many things, Calista and I have so many memories from so many parts of the state. Everybody, including people who by accident or misinformation were for the other candidates, but everybody was nice to us everywhere. And I just want to say that I think South Carolina showed southern hospitality as beautifully as anyplace we've been.I also want to mention in particular General Livingston, who is a Congressional Medal of Honor Winner, who gave me the great honor in Yorktown of introducing me yesterday. And to a man of that courage, that patriotism and that dedication to freedom to come out and support us really meant a great deal. And everybody who went to the Yorktown, it was a remarkable evening and I'm just grateful to everybody for that moment of patriotism. [applause]That is a -- the biggest thing I take from the campaign in South Carolina is that it is very humbling and very sobering to have so many people who so deeply want their country to get back on the right track. [applause]And so many people who are so concerned about jobs, about medical costs, about the everyday parts of life and who feel that the elites in Washington and New York have no understanding, no care, no concern, no reliability and, in fact, do not represent them at all. [applause]In the two debates that we had here in Myrtle Beach and then in Charleston where people reacted so strongly to the news media, I think there was something very fundamental that I wish the powers that be in the news media would take seriously.The American people feel that they have elites who have been trying for a half-century to force to us quit being American and become some kind of other system. [applause]And their reaction -- people completely misunderstand what's going on. It's not that I am a good debater. It is that I articulate the deepest felt values of the American people -- [applause] -- you know, this is a remarkable system. What makes us different from virtually every other country in the world is that we are free. And because we're free, we can produce leadership from an amazing range of places.Now sometimes that leadership is good. We once have an actor who made movies with chimpanzees. He turned out to be one of our greatest presidents, and ended up with the disappearance of the Soviet empire. [applause]We once had a peanut farmer nuclear physicist; he didn't turn out to be quite as good. But the genius of America is that you can come from any background. I watched tonight the fine speeches of the other three candidates on our side, and I was struck with how much they reflected the openness of the American system.You know, Rick Santorum showed enormous courage in Iowa when he had no money, nobody covered him and he just kept campaigning. His -- [applause]I rest my case. I mean, he has made an impact, right? I mean, here's a guy who articulates the values of social conservatism, who articulates the importance of manufacturing and who may have been as right about the dangers of Iran as anybody in this country in the last 10 years. [applause]And then as a further example of how wide open our system is, you have Dr. Ron Paul, who on the issue of money and the Federal Reserve has been right for 25 years. [applause]And while I disagree with him on many other things, there is no doubt that a lot of his critique of inflation, of fiat money and of the Federal Reserve is in fact absolutely the right direction and is something I can support strongly.And finally, Governor Romney, with whom I disagree on many issues, is nonetheless a good example of America. He's hard working, he has been very successful, he has organized large systems, he did a terrific job at the Winter Olympics.And the fact is if you look at the four of us, we are proof you can come from a wide range of backgrounds and in America you have a chance to try to make your case no matter what the elites think in New York and Washington. [applause]Well, you sort of now just captured the heart of this campaign. The fact is we want to run not a Republican campaign, we want to run an American campaign -- [applause] -- because we are optimists about the future, because America has always been optimistic about the future, and we believe as our new sign, which just got made today, points out, that if we unleash the American people, we can rebuild the America that we love. [applause] Now, I believe and Callista and I decided to run because we, after a year of conversation, concluded that this is the most important election of our lifetime. If Barack Obama can get re- elected after this disaster, right, just think how radical he would be in a second term. So I have a proposal. With your help, we are now moving on to Florida and beyond -- [applause] -- and I want you to know that if -- and by the way, anyone here who knows anyone in Florida, please contact them by sometime tomorrow, OK? [applause]And my good friend, Luis Hasa, knows many people in Florida, and I'm confident he'll have an impact. But if I do become your nominee -- and I think with your help I will become your nominee -- but with your help, together, if that happens, then it's all up to all of us to work to make it happen.If that happens, then I will challenge President Obama to seven three- hour debates. [applause]To be fair, to be fair -- I don't want to you be disappointed, but I already have conceded that he can use a teleprompter if he wants to. After all, if you had to defend ObamaCare, wouldn't you want to be able to use a teleprompter? [applause]Now, there a number of key issues that we have to talk about with the president. I'm going to get there in a second. [laughter]I believe this campaign comes down to economics, including jobs, economic growth, balancing the budget, the value of money, comes down to national security, what threatens us and what we have to do about it.But the centerpiece of this campaign, I believe, is American exceptionalism versus the radicalism of Saul Alinsky. [applause]Well, you know, there's a lot to just doing that because the fact is what we are going to argue is that American exceptionalism, the American Declaration of Independence, the American Constitution, the American Federalist Papers, the Founding Fathers of America are the source from which we draw our understanding of America, he draws his from Saul Alinsky, radical left-wingers, and people who don't like the classical American.And one of the issues -- one of the issues we're going to address head-on --She would be a great first lady and with your help, she will be a great first lady. [applause]One of -- one of the key issues -- and I'm prepared to take this straight at the president and, frankly, straight at the elite media, one of the key issues is the growing anti-religious bigotry of our elites. [applause]And if you get a chance, if you go to newt.org, my campaign site, there's a 54-page paper there on the balance of power putting the judiciary back in its proper role and eliminating dictatorial religious bigots ,such as Judge Barry in San Antonio, who issued a ruling that if the students -- not only could the students not pray at their graduation, if they used the word benediction, the word invocation, the word God, asked the audience to stand or asked for a moment of silence, he would put the superintendent in jail.Now we don't have speech dictatorship in America by anti-religious bigots, period. [applause]The second big theme, frankly, is one that every South Carolinian understands, it's jobs, economic growth, balancing the budget, having stable money. Let's be very clear -- and, again, this makes some of the elite media nervous.President Obama has been historically the most effective food stamp president in American history. [applause]I worked with Ronald Reagan to create jobs, and 16 million jobs were created by the American people in the 1980s. I worked with Bill Clinton, a Democrat, to create jobs, and 11 million jobs were created by the American people during the four years that I was Speaker.I would like to be the best paycheck president in American history, and I want to go into every neighborhood of every ethnic background in every part of the country and say to people very simply, if you want your children to have a life of dependency and food stamps, you have a candidate, it's Barack Obama. If you want your children to have a life of independency and paychecks, you have a candidate and it's Newt Gingrich and I'll bet you we have votes everywhere. [applause]Part of the job in the economy, frankly, is to shrink the power of Washington. I just talked tonight with Governor Rick Perry, who is deeply committed, and I was very generous for his endorsement this week. His passion is implementing the 10th Amendment. We are going to work with him to return power to the states, to local governments, to get it out of Washington, D.C. [applause]The one reason that I asked to you be with me and not just for me, if we shrink the Washington bureaucracy, we have to grow citizenship back home to fill the vacuum.I'm also committed to getting back to a balanced budget and since I'm the only Speaker of the House in your lifetime to have helped create four consecutive balanced budgets, I think I can tell you, as president I will work very hard to get back to a balanced budget as rapidly as possible and then to run a surplus to pay down the debt, so no Chinese leverage exists on the United States by having our debt. [applause]Part of our long-term national security has to be having an American energy policy. I want America to become so energy independent that no American president ever again bows to a Saudi king. [applause]And let me give you an example of a common sense conservatism that solves problems. You have well over $29 billion of natural gas offshore. If -- and as president I will authorize on the very first day the development of it. That natural gas offshore will create jobs that in Louisiana average $80,000 apiece. In addition, it generates royalties.Part of the royalties should be used to modernize the port of Charleston, which affects one out of every five jobs in South Carolina. But it's not -- it's not enough just to find the money. The Corps of Engineers current bureaucracy is so long and so stupid that they currently take eight years to study -- not to do the project, to study the project.We fought the entire Second World War in three years and eight months. Now if you can beat Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and Imperial Japan in three years and eight months, it is almost unimaginable that it now takes eight years to study the project.So I want to fundamentally overhaul the entire federal government at every level to produce a modern, lean, effective federal government. [applause]Let me also say that the president's decision to veto the Keystone pipeline -- you know, you have to wonder how out of touch with reality this administration is.It's one thing to say that they can't play chess at the White House. It's another thing to say they can't play checkers at the White House. But if they can't play tic-tac-toe, the president says, no, we don't want you to build a pipeline from central Canada, straight down with no mountains intervening, to the largest petrochemical center in the world, Houston, so that we would make money on the pipeline, we'd make money on managing the pipeline, we'd make money on refining the oil and we'd make money in the ports of Houston and Galveston shipping the oil.Oh, no, we don't want to do that because Barack Obama is taking care of his extremist left-wing friends in San Francisco. They think that will really stop the oil from getting out.No, what Prime Minister Harper, who by the way is a conservative and pro-American, what he has said is he's going to cut a deal with the Chinese, and they'll build a pipeline straight across the Rockies to Vancouver. We'll get none of the jobs, none of the energy, none of the opportunity.Now, an American president who can create a Chinese-Canadian partnership is truly a danger to this country. [applause]But it gets worse. Last Sunday the Saudis announced they were signing a deal with the Chinese to build nuclear energy facilities in Saudi Arabia. So the Saudis are now saying we so distrust the Obama administration, we'd rather rely on the Chinese.The Iranians for two weeks taunt us with exercises aimed at closing the Straits of Hormuz, and the Obama administration's answer is to cancel military exercises with Israel because we don't want to provoke the Iranians? President Obama is a president so weak that he makes Jimmy Carter look strong.Let me just say that I believe the debate we're going to have with President Obama over the next eight or nine months, the outlining of the two Americas, the America of the Declaration of Independence, the America of Saul Alinsky; the America of paychecks, the America of food stamps; the America of independence, the America of dependence; the America of strength in foreign policy, the America of weakness in foreign policy -- those two choices I believe will give the American people a chance to decide permanently whether we want to remain the historic America that has provided opportunity for more people of more backgrounds than any country in history, or whether, in fact, we prefer to become a brand-new secular, European-style bureaucratic socialist system. I agree with you. I'm running because Callista and I have looked at the future for Maggie and Robert and we decided, no, we're not going to go the route of Obama and these kind of radical ideas. [applause]So in order to carry out this great debate, to rally the American people to reasserting their belief in America, to winning the election decisively this fall, to profoundly changing Washington starting on day one, when, by the way, we abolish all the White House czars -- [applause] -- to do that -- to do that we need to build on this victory by going to Florida. I need your help in reaching out to people in Florida, I need your help in finding anybody who believes in what we're doing and telling them to go to newt.org, just my first name, to sign up, to donate, to get involved.We don't have the kind of money that at least one of the candidates has, but we do have ideas and we do have people and we have proved here in South Carolina that people power, with the right ideas, beats big money. And with your help we're going to prove it again in Florida. Thank you. Good luck and God bless you. TranscriptThank you all very, very much. And thank all of you up here. I particularly want to start by thanking Attorney General Bill McCollum, who just has been a great state-wide leader and has done so much to help us and he and Ingrid have just been tremendous.I also want to thank Mayor Krotty and Adam Levine who co-chaired statewide and really helped us put this together in a remarkably short time. And so we're very grateful to all of you.I also want to introduce my daughter Kathy and her husband, Paul, they live down in Key Biscayne. [cheers and applause]And I'm very proud of Kathy because she did a whole series of Spanish language media over the last couple of weeks helping us in the Miami area, and really reaching out across all the Spanish community and also my daughter Jackie and her husband Jimmy who are here. [cheers and applause]And Jackie has been -- Jackie has been doing speeches, doing television and radio. And as many of you know, she is the -- she and Jimmy are the mother and father of my two major debate coaches, Maggie and Robert. So it's great to have them here.I want to thank Floridians. Callista and I talked about this. And everybody here has been so positive in every part of the state, that we just thank all of you for the hospitality and the kindness. We thank the well over a half million Floridians who voted for us.And I think Florida did something very important, coming on top of South Carolina. It is now clear that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate. [cheers and applause]And the voters of Florida really made that clear. Now you'll notice a number of folks are holding up a sign about 46 states to go. [cheers and applause]We did this in part for the elite media, because, you know, the same people who said I was dead in June and July, and said I was gone after Iowa, who seemed totally quiet the night of the South Carolina victory, are now going to be back saying, what's he going to do? What's he going to do? What's he going to do?So I just want to reassure them tonight, we are going to contest every place and we are going to win and we will be in Tampa as the nominee in August. [cheers and applause]CROWD: Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt.GINGRICH: Now, you might ask, in the face of a 5-1 onslaught, how can that be true? And I'll give you the answer. It was stated at an historic moment in 1863, in dedicating our first National Military Cemetery by the president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, who said we have government of the people, by the people, for the people. And we're going to have people power defeat money power in the next six months. [cheers and applause]And you might say, how are we going to do that? Well, the same way that we came back in June and July and by December, we're ahead in the Gallup poll nationally by 12 or 13 points with no money. It turned out that if you have ideas and you have solutions and you're positive and you can communicate a better future, and you have a history of actually doing something in the past, that the combination begins to reach to the American people.So let me talk briefly about what this is going to be about. This is the most important election of your lifetime. [cheers and applause]If Barack Obama gets re-elected, it will be a disaster for the United States of America. Make no bones about it. If he can have a record this bad, unemployment this bad, deficits this bad, policies this bad, gasoline prices this high, and still get re- elected, you can't imagine how radical he'll be in his second term.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's right.GINGRICH: So designing and putting together a people's campaign, not a Republican campaign, not an establishment campaign, not a Wall Street funded campaign, a people's campaign, and saying to every American of every background and every ethnic group and every community, we have a better future for you and your family. It's a future of jobs, it's a future of lower gasoline prices, it's a future of a balanced budget, it's a future of a smaller Washington, it's a future of more power back home to you and your family and your neighborhood.This is a future we ask you to join us in imposing on the establishment in Washington and imposing it on both parties. [cheers and applause]Let's talk briefly about the power of ideas. In 1980, I was very honored to be able to help put together the first Capitol Steps event. And at that point, Senate and House candidates came together with Governor Reagan. David Broder wrote about it in the "Washington Post" as a very courageous decision by Reagan because he didn't have to run as part of a team. And he did something nobody had done before. And we won six U.S. Senate seats by a combined margin of 75,000 votes and we picked up 33 House seats.In 1994, building on that experience, we got 350 candidates to come and to be part of a "Contract with America," to stand on the capitol steps. We offered a positive program and we had the largest one-party increase in American history in an off-year. Nine million additional Americans voted for a positive vision and we kept our word and every item on the contract was voted on in the first 93 days. [cheers and applause]There's a core question both in the primaries and in the general election. A simple question. If you're comfortable with the way America is decaying, then we don't have to change much. We can just manage the decay. If you think that's a terrible thing to do to your children and grandchildren, it's a terrible thing to do to your country, and if you are prepared to do what it takes to make sure that we change direction, not just the presidency, but the Congress, the bureaucracy, the judges, the policies, so that the entire system gets on the right track, so that America can give our children and grandchildren a more prosperous, a safe and better future, this is how big the gap is.But there are folks over here in both parties who are quite comfortable managing the decay. I am running, Callista and I made the decision to run, our children, our son-in-laws joined us in that decision because we believe it is cheating our grandchildren to not insist on fundamental basic change in Washington, even if the establishment doesn't like it. [cheers and applause]CROWD: Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt.GINGRICH: In the next few days, we're going to develop the equivalent of the contract from 1994, except this is going to be a personal one between me and you, because I'm asking you to make me president and therefore, I have a personal responsibility. It's going to come in two parts. Part one is conditional and requires your help. Part two, I can do if I win the election, without having to condition it.Part one only works if you help me and we run a team campaign, which means, by the way, we have to replace Bill Nelson with a conservative. [cheers and applause]But if you help us, and in addition to winning the presidency, we elect a Republican Senate and a Republican House, I will ask them on January 3rd to stay in office, and I will ask them to immediate pass the repeal of Obama-care. [cheers and applause]I will ask them to immediately pass the repeal of the Dodd-Frank bill, which is killing housing, killing small business and killing independent banks. [cheers and applause]And I will ask them to pass the repeal of Sarbanes- Oxley, which is crippling American businesses with no net profit. [cheers and applause]And my goal is to have all three bills sitting there, waiting, so the minute I am sworn in, I can sign all three and we're off to a pretty good opening morning. [cheers and applause]Now those three promises are conditional. We have to win the Senate by a big enough margin to manage it and we have to increase our strength in the House. Help me do that, I'll do those three.Now let me tell you some things and we're going to put this together in a way that you'll be able to see in writing with my signature and you'll be able to hold me accountable. There are a series of executive orders I can issue that the Congress can't stop as long as they're within the law. The very first executive order will abolish all of the White House czars as of that moment. [cheers and applause]We will issue immediately an executive order on the same day. All of this is going to happen about two hours after the inaugural address.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right.GINGRICH: OK? No point in hanging out and having fun. Before we get to go to the various balls that night, we're going to have a work period. This is going to be a working presidency.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.GINGRICH: I may not get in as much golf as Obama, but I'll get in a lot more job creation.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's right. [cheers and applause]GINGRICH: And I tell you up front, I'm not going to compete with Obama in singing because I'm not running for entertainer-in-chief, I'm running for president. [cheers]And I would say to him now, Mr. President, you cannot sing your way past the disaster of your presidency. [cheers and applause]Now, we will immediately -- you know, I forgot my teleprompter, I said to my staff earlier. [laughter]I mean, I'm having to wing this because of the staff failure.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You don't need it.GINGRICH: So we're going to sign on that day the authorization for the immediate deployment of the Keystone Pipeline as of that day. [cheers and applause]My message to the people of Canada is, don't cut a deal with the Chinese. Help is on the way, by January, you're going to build the right pipeline to the right place. [cheers and applause]I'll just give you a couple more. We're going to put together a package. You're going to see, this is what a serious conservative president is like, who is bold and is prepared to change Washington despite the screams of the establishment on both parties. So a couple more steps. We will on that day sign an executive order that will instruct the State Department that day to open the embassy in Jerusalem and recognize Israel. [cheers and applause]CROWD: Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt.GINGRICH: Just two more examples. I will sign on that day an executive order reinstating Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy, no U.S. money will go anywhere in the world to pay for abortion, period. [cheers and applause]And finally, many of you may have noticed that the Obama administration has declared war on the Catholic Church and other religious institutions. I want you to know that on the very first day, I will sign an executive order repealing every anti-religious act of the Obama administration as of that moment. [cheers and applause]The reason I am comfortable telling you all this is I have been studying what America needs to do since the fall of 1958, when my dad was stationed in Europe in the army. I have been working at what we need to do, as congressman, speaker of the House, in the private sector.I believe it is possible to get this country back on track. My commitment is to unleash the spirit of the American people, to find new and innovative and positive things, to do them seven days a week, to do them relentlessly, to do them without stop, to make sure that we have fundamentally gotten America back on the right track.And I pledge to each and every one of you personally, if you will reach out across the country, if you will use Facebook and YouTube and Twitter, and phone calls and even visits, if you will tell all of your friends in the other 46 states that there is a chance to nominate a conservative who knows what he is doing, who has done it before, and who has the courage and determination to get it done, I promise you that if I become your president, I pledge to you my life, my fortune, and my sacred honor. This is about America.Thank you. Good luck and God bless you. [remarks joined in progress]REPORTER: [inaudible] continue a lot, you know, in public places. What --GINGRICH: Did you miss me? REPORTER: We did. [laughter]GINGRICH: Thank you. I feel good. I was worrying that you would not have noticed. REPORTER: What kind of conversations took place and what some of the conclusions that's been out there?GINGRICH: Well, we got together for a very practical reason. I was surprised by the degree to which the establishment has closed ranks and made quite clear that they're desperate over the prospect of a Gingrich presidency. I was surprised by George Soros, cheerfully explaining in Davos that he was happy with either Obama or Romney, because it didn't make much difference in policy, it was just a change of personality.And I was surprised at "The New York Times" article on the Romney campaign's decision that they had to destroy Newt Gingrich. So we stopped and said all right, if this -- if this is the objective reality of the campaign, the entire establishment will be against us, the scale of Wall Street money starting with Goldman Sachs will be amazing, and the campaign will be based on things that aren't true.Then how do you define the campaign for the average American so they get to choose, do they want two George Soros-approved candidates in the general election or would they like a conservative versus one George Soros-approved candidate?And we frankly have spent the last four days laying out a campaign for the next few months in which, although we will be outspent, we think we can communicate through the clutter and we think we'll be able to draw decisively for the American people how big the difference is.You know Reagan had this challenge with John Conley. Goldwater had this challenge with Nelson Rockefeller. We've had past Republican campaigns in which the establishment had massive financial advantages. Reagan lost five straight primaries before he began winning in 1976.I'm pretty comfortable that when you come down to it, as we go state to state to state, a pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-tax increase, George Soros-approved candidate of the establishment probably is not going to do very well. And I'm happy to have that debate with Governor Romney and I will debate him one-on-one anywhere, any time that he's willing to stand up and explain his record without the kind of gimmicks he used in Florida. REPORTER: Mr. Speaker, you seem to be looking past -- [crosstalk]GINGRICH: No, no. Right here.REPORTER: I'm sorry.GINGRICH: [inaudible]. Everybody will get a chance. The Super Bowl is not until 3:29. [laughter]That is not option for [inaudible]. Go ahead. REPORTER: There are reports that Sheldon Adelson has been meeting with Mitt Romney and has said that he will, you know, help him financially?GINGRICH: Who? REPORTER: Sheldon?GINGRICH: I have no idea. REPORTER: Do you -- would that bother you if he is --GINGRICH: First of all, I think what he's quoted as saying is if I had dropped out he would be willing to support Governor Romney. And I will ask him myself. If the choice is Obama and Romney, then there's no choice. I think that's how -- that's how Sheldon Adelson feels.Look, Sheldon's primary driving force is the survival of the United States and Israel in the face of an Iranian nuclear weapon. And compared to Barack Obama, virtually anybody is a better candidate. So that doesn't matter me at all. Yes, ma'am? REPORTER: Ty. Mr. Speaker, you seem to be looking past the February states and really aiming at Super Tuesday. How much of your focus in the next couple of weeks is going to be on Super Tuesday states? You're obviously spending a lot of time in Ohio this week. Can you lay out what the next month will mean in terms of a Super Tuesday strategy?GINGRICH: Well, one of the things that some of you, as you keep score, you don't quite follow me on is I actually think we're a national system in terms of information flow. So I think if -- you know, if I'm on "Hannity" or if I happen to be in Associated Press, to take an example, or if I'm on one of the networks or even in "The New York Times," that in fact it reaches the whole country.So I run a campaign which twice now has made me the frontrunner and I suspect will again by the Texas primary or so, that really is a national campaign. I think next week this coming week, we're in Colorado, Minnesota, and Ohio. And then we do CPAC in Washington. I think the follow Monday we start three days in California. And -- you know, so we're going to be all over the place again and again and again. But we intend to compete in every single state in the country, and I think you can count on us being competitive in every single state in the country. Yes, sir? REPORTER: Nancy Pelosi came out and said that she stands with her fellow Catholics in favor of President Obama's decision on the [inaudible].GINGRICH: She stands with her fellow Catholics. REPORTER: That's what she said. I was talking about the --GINGRICH: Her fellow Catholics meaning Archbishop Dolan, the entire hierarchy, every bishop, every priest? Those are her fellow Catholics? REPORTER: That's who she says.GINGRICH: I just -- well, you might go and ask the Archbishop Dolan how and whether or not he thinks the term "fellow Catholic" applies to Archbishop Dolan.Yes, sir? REPORTER: Do you consider --GINGRICH: Let me go back for a second to say to you, the Obama administration has declared war on religious freedom in this country. And people need to understand that. This is a decision so totally outrageous, and then the illustration of such radical secular ideology, that I believe the entire hierarchy will oppose it every inch of the way. It has nothing to do with specific details. It has to do with whether or not the government of the United States can tell a religious institution you must give up your religious beliefs.Now that's what Obamacare has come to mean. The right of a Washington politician and a Washington bureaucrat to tell you that you may no longer worship God the way you want unless you're willing to pay a penalty for doing so. And I think as the average American comes to understand that, they will be repulsed at the arrogance and the anti-religious bigotry of the Obama administration.Yes, back there. REPORTER: Mr. Speaker, have you considered also that perhaps voters just aren't buying what you're selling? I mean you've been on the ball now in five states, you've won one but you've lost four. And you also talk about debates, but you've had 18 of them and generally you've been considered to have done well in them, and still it's not showing up in the polls. [crosstalk]GINGRICH: I'm not going to defend the outcome in a state where I was outspent 5-1. And I suggest you're sophisticated enough you understand that the idea of taking a state where the other guy spent five times as much money, and many of his ads were false, as described by both the "Wall Street Journal" and "National Review", that maybe that's not a very accurate measure. When it was an entirely positive campaign, up through mid-December, I was ahead by 12 points in the Gallup.I want to come back, again, I was actually ahead in Gallup about a week ago. So I think in a few more weeks I'll be ahead in Gallup again. REPORTER: Is that just ignoring the reality of the campaign? I mean he has gone negative and it's working, and you know --GINGRICH: Right. So throughout the campaign, to use your words, he has gone negative, and it is working. And what I'm asserting to you is over time, I don't believe the American people will approve of a campaign which actually suppresses turnout. I think it's amazing, if you all look at Florida, every county I carried in Florida had an increased turnout. Every county Romney carried in Florida had a decreased turnout.Now that's just sober, every Republican in the country, if the only way that Romney is suppressing turnout, how is he going to -- how is he going to do that in the fall if the only way he wins is outspending somebody 5-1? How is that going to apply to a campaign against Obama who is going to outspend him?I just suggest here that there are underlying factors in this race, and I'm quite happy to continue campaigning, and I'm kind of mildly amazed at the news media's desperation for finding some excuse to say, wouldn't you please quit this evening?REPORTER: Jeff. REPORTER: [inaudible] successful going forward, Mitt Romney is still in the path the way his record now. [inaudible].GINGRICH: Well, first of all, I'm not sure that Mitt Romney is in my head. I mean think that's an interesting analysis on your part. I'm sure that with a psychiatric degree that will get you a tremendous opportunity to have new clients. I think there's a clear contrast. I think that the clear contrast is really important. And I think that over time we're going to drive home that clear contrast in a way which will be enormously to his disadvantage.I think the American people want somebody who is genuinely conservative, who is prepared to change Washington. Just take -- take his one comment this week about not caring about the poor, which we know was a mistake. Just as common about liking to fire people was a mistake. Et cetera.I would suggest to you that a conservative who cares about the poor, a conservative who cares about every American of every background, a conservative who says, why don't we rethink the entire safety net so it becomes a trampoline, which is not me. It's Jack Kemp. It's a whole range of people who've been working on these ideas for 25 years.And as Charles Krauthammer said, Romney's comments this week were a sign he doesn't quite understand conservative philosophy. Now I think that's important for the country, for Republicans, for conservatives to think about. Nominating one more moderate, like 1996 when we lost badly, like 2008 when we lost badly, I don't think that's a very good future for the Republican Party.And because it's vital to beat Barack Obama, I don't think it's a very good future for the country.Yes, sir? REPORTER: [inaudible]GINGRICH: Yes. I was just -- I was surprised. Go back and look at the second debate. I've never had a person stand next to me in a civil engagement and be a substantially dishonest as he was. I mean go look at what he said. You have Larry Sabato in the middle of the debate tweeting that Romney was being factually false.Now I didn't have any good mechanisms, I will by the next debate. I didn't have any good mechanisms to turn to somebody who was being blatantly dishonest to the entire country as a candidate to the president. If you can't tell the truth as a candidate for the president, which is by the way a charge that has been made by McCain, by Fred Thompson, by Huckabee.If you can't tell the truth as a candidate for president, how can the country possibly expect you to lead as president? And I frankly was stunned. I make no bones about this. In the second Florida debate, I had nothing to say, because I had nothing to say because I had never before seen a person who I thought of as a serious candidate for president be that fundamentally dishonest. And it was blatant and it was deliberate and he knew he was doing it. REPORTER: Do you plan on dealing with that?GINGRICH: I will -- I don't want to tell you now. Please, Jeff, you have to give us a few trade secrets. Yes, ma'am?REPORTER: You mentioned that Romney [inaudible]GINGRICH: No. I think this is a state he won last time. I think we will do better than John McCain did last time. And John McCain went on to a reasonably good success. Yes, ma'am? REPORTER: [inaudible]GINGRICH: I haven't seen -- I haven't seen the reports. I have no idea what they're referring to. And I'll be happy to look at them.Yes, sir? REPORTER: Last night you said you're ashamed of the negativity in this campaign. First, have you engaged yourself in any negativity in this campaign?GINGRICH: Of course. REPORTER: And are you willing to commit to give up any negativity for the remainder of --GINGRICH: You can't unilaterally disarm in a world where somebody is willing to be as aggressive. What? REPORTER: If you're ashamed of it, why not?GINGRICH: Because as you know, as a realistic person, you might as well withdraw from the campaign. Now that's a fact. REPORTER: You don't think you could win this campaign with a positive -- purely positive?GINGRICH: No. I tried that -- I think if you were with me in Iowa saw it. I stayed relentlessly positive in Iowa and lost 22 points. When we were in a totally positive campaign, I was beating Romney by huge margin. REPORTER: So if you're ashamed of it but -- [crosstalk]GINGRICH: I think it's terrible -- you know, because I think it's terrible that the American system is reduced to negative ads, some of them false. I wish it wasn't happening, and I think we would be better serving our children and grandchildren if it wasn't happening. But it's a fact. It is a fact. And unfortunately it's a fact and if you're not willing to stand and fight, then you have to get out of the race. And I think that's a very sad comment. Yes, ma'am?KEILAR: Some sources have suggested that you've decided you want to go more positive in the tone, but that doesn't really seem to match your news conference. So is that true and what do you want to see about the tone moving forward?GINGRICH: Well, I think we're going to make a whole series of positive speeches. And again, I'm perfectly happy to talk about the idea of turning the safety net into a trampoline. I'm perfectly happy to talk about ideas we have for creating a much better future in terms of tax cuts and less regulation.I gave an entire speech last night at a local church, which was a positive statement about American exceptionalism and the nature of America. And I'm very happy to do that. I also predict to you that it is relatively harder to get your profession to cover totally positive speeches. So I can give hours and hours of totally positive speeches. Now that doesn't necessarily mean they'll show up anywhere.KEILAR: Is it positive -- Newt, if I may follow, is it positive about -- is it a positive message about America's future but negative about Mitt Romney? Is that the plan?GINGRICH: Well, I think the point is, there is a positive future for America if we elect a conservative, and I'm happy to talk about why that's true and I'm happy to talk about why I think it's very, very hard for somebody who invented Romneycare to be part of that future.Yes, ma'am?REPORTER: [inaudible]GINGRICH: What?REPORTER: The article that mistakenly said that Trump would endorse you, do you think that was [inaudible] anyway, and are you hoping to find other endorsement?GINGRICH: I mean I couldn't understand those articles when they came out because nobody I knew thought he was going to endorse me. So we all thought it was kind of weird. And those of you who wrote those articles ought to go back to their sources and ask why they misinformed you. But it's a free country.Look, there are few people better at manipulating the press than Donald Trump and he proved it once again. You know, I -- you have to admire the sheer -- yes, ma'am?REPORTER: You cheered the fact that you don't use political consultants in your campaign, the explanation that we've gotten many times is that you are the brains behind in this, the machine behind your campaign. You talked about not responding quickly enough to Governor Romney. Do you think that if you would've had consultants, it would have been different and are you looking at adding consultants moving forward?GINGRICH: No. It wouldn't have been. First of all, how is a consultant going to train you in advance and say to you in advance -- I mean until I saw "The New York Times" article about the discussion they had last Sunday morning, it hadn't occurred to me that you would have the level of ruthlessness and the level of dishonesty we saw last week. And I've been around a long time and have been through a fair number of campaigns and a fair number of fights.And the language in that article is startling and I think frankly, a break with the American tradition.Yes, sir? What?REPORTER: Is it fair to say you are running your campaign and you are your own campaign manager?GINGRICH: Well, no, I think Michael Crow is the campaign manager. We have a lot of very smart people, but it's fair to say that when it comes to what the candidate does and what the candidate says, that I bear full responsibility. I don't get talking points, I don't get coaching in a sense that apparently Governor Romney did until they fired the guy who was coaching him, which I think is by the way pretty bizarre.I mean here you have a guy who comes in and does a pretty good job. The only two debates Romney has done well he was coached by this guy and they fire him? It's just kind of weird. You're the last question. Last question. REPORTER: You talked about the difficulties in running a campaign. [inaudible]. Reports are coming out that your campaign still have $600,000 in debt. Can you [inaudible] some finances --GINGRICH: I don't understand where that report came from because it doesn't fit our internal numbers and it doesn't fit, you know, I mean, some clever person went back and jury-rigged their interpretation of the last 30 days. REPORTER: You talk about running [inaudible], how about --GINGRICH: Well, that's the one -- that's the one state we frankly messed up in. And I've been pretty honest about that. You know. We did the wrong thing, hired the wrong person, it didn't work. But we'll be in 49 states and the territories. And we'll be very, very competitive in all of them.Listen, I hope you all have a great Super Bowl. Take a few hours off from politics. Try to enjoy life. Thank you very much. [applause]BLITZER: All right. If you thought that there was going to be a softer, milder Newt Gingrich, forget about it. Newt Gingrich making it absolutely, positively clear. Hold on a second.GINGRICH: Forget all this other junk. OK? Paul Lubbers is my son-in-law who's from Sheboygan who for Christmas gave my daughter one share of Packer stock and I [inaudible] one share. We had a serious conference call, and we concluded that we should be for the team that beat the Pack. Now it's painful, but I'm for the Giants, period. There you go. [applause] Download Newt's CPAC HandoutTranscriptGINGRICH: Thank you, Callista. What she did not tell you, by the way, is I am a very bad golfer.(Applause).GINGRICH: I want to thank Dave Bossie, who has been such a great friend and partner with us on so many different projects. I also — just as a personal note — want to thank Ralph Hallow and CPAC for recognizing last night, Tony Blankley, who was such a great friend.(Applause).GINGRICH: And I want to thank the Newt 2012 volunteers who have been here working and made such a difference. We are a people-based campaign, and our volunteers are really important.(Applause).GINGRICH: I have spoken at CPAC many times. And CPAC was founded to challenge the Republican establishment. The fact is: When Ronald Reagan came here in 1974 and gave his famous speech on bold colors, no pale pastels, that was a decade in from Reagan's first, great national speech for Barry Goldwater, A Time For Choosing. When Reagan campaigned in 1980, you could see the gap between the Republican establishment and theconservative movement. Reagan campaigned on supply-side economics, lower taxes, less regulation, more American energy, place for people to create jobs. The establishment called it "voodoo economics." The GOP establishment has a single word they use with contempt for conservative ideas: They say they are "unrealistic." So creating 16 million jobs under Reagan — "unrealistic."Ending the Soviet Union — "unrealistic."And Faith Whittlesey, who was in the Reagan White House and ambassador to Switzerland, wrote a brilliant piece recently for Newsmax, pointing out that the fight she and Iwere in as conservatives against the Republican establishment, over the very question of whether or not we should have an anti-Soviet campaign.The 1994 "Contract with America" — "unrealistic."The House Republican majority of 1994, which by the way, was elected by the largest one-party increase in an off year in American History — 9 million new voters — "unrealistic."Reforming welfare — where two out of three people would go to work or go to school — "unrealistic."Cutting taxes with the largest capital gains tax cut — first tax cut in 16 years — unemployment drops to 4.2 percent, 11 million new jobs — "unrealistic."Four years of a balanced-budget — "unrealistic."(Applause).GINGRICH: For the Republican establishment, managing the decay is preferable to changing the trajectory because changing the trajectory requires real fight and requires a real willingness to roll up sleeves and actually take on the Left. And that is why the Republican establishment, whether it is in 1996 or in 2008, can't win a presidential campaign because they don't have the toughness; they don't have the commitment; and they don't have the philosophy necessary to build a majority in this country.(Applause).GINGRICH: And let me say to the Republican establishment in this city — crony capitalism in Congress is fully as bad as crony capitalism on Wall Street, and they had better clean up the Congress if they expect to be reelected.(Applause).GINGRICH: Now, CPAC actually represents a 50-year struggle that goes back to the Draft Goldwater Movement in 1962. And the Tea Party versus the Republican establishment is, in many ways, the same fight. This has been going on for a half century. And the core of it is very simple: The conservative movement when it offers bold solutions to rally millions of Americans, not just Republicans, millions of Americans, Democrats, Independents, people who maynever have been in politics; then it wins decisively. 1980, 1984, 1994 are examples of that.What I want to talk to you about today is bold solutions to get American working again, and I'm going to contrast it with the stupidity that comes from managing the decay. Two examples: We won the Second World War from December 7, 1941 to August 1945. I want you to lock this in your heads as an example of what America can do when you unleash the American people. In 44 months, three years and eight months, we defeated Nazi Germany, fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan, 44 months. Recently, it took 23 years to add a fifth runway to the Atlanta airport. When people say you really can't control the border by January 1, 2014, they are describing the America that can't. That is the establishment, America, tied up in bureaucracy, tied up in red tape, tied up in incompetence, tied up in interest groups.(Applause).GINGRICH: Let me be really clear, all of you have seen the Washington establishment and the Wall Street establishment pile on top of me. All of you have seen them say things that which is profoundly false. And there is a good reason they are doing it. This campaign is a mortal threat to their grip on the establishment, because we intend to change Washington, not accommodate it.(Applause).GINGRICH: So let's say the speed, the toughness, the emphasis of the Second World War and let's take something we should make all of us optimistic: There is a world that works. Most of it, but not all of it is in the private sector. And there is a world that fails. Most of it, but not all of it is in the public sector. I will give you one single example: How many of you have ever gone online to check a package at UPS or FedEx? Raise your hand if you have ever checked for a package? (Audience raises hands.)GINGRICH: So virtually all of you. I want to stop for a second. I want to drive this home. This is not a theory: It is a practical reality that we have the technology that enables us to track between UPS and FedEx. We track 24 million packages a day while they are moving, and we allow you to find out where they are for free. That is the world that works. Now here's the world that fails: The federal government today cannot find 11 million illegal immigrants, even if they are sitting still.(Applause).GINGRICH: Now, I have a simple proposal: We send a package —(Laughter). GINGRICH: To everyone who is here illegally, and when it is delivered, we pull them up on a computer. We know where they are.(Laughter). GINGRICH: Let me say for my friends in the news media: That was hyperbole, and we don't need a fact check.(Laughter and applause).GINGRICH: Now, I am going to give you a series of solutions that are big enough to get America back on the right track. And I think this has been the greatest challenge of this campaign. We have lots of bickering; we have lots of arguments about this and that. We have virtually no discussion of what does it really take to take the most complicated society in the world, the largest economy in the world, and move it back to being the most successful, most prosperous, safest and freest country in the world. So I am going to try this afternoon to set the stage for that.And we have tons of details at Newt.org — any of you want, to just go to my first name dot org. You will see an immense amount of material.But the standard here is that solutions big enough to get America working again — and the principle is to unleash the American people to rebuild the America we love. Let me start with jobs: If I am the nominee, with your help, I will ask the entire Republican ticket to campaign with me on the pledge that when the Congress comes in on January 3, it will stay in session, and by January 20, when I am sworn in, it will have repealed Obamacare.(Applause).GINGRICH: It will have repealed Dodd-Frank.(Applause).GINGRICH: It will have repealed Sarbanes-Oxley.(Applause).GINGRICH: All three of those are job killing bills, which centralized bureaucracy in Washington DC and increased the corruption of the political system. All three should be repealed and held at the desk until I am sworn in. That afternoon, on the very first day, we should sign the repeal of all three. That's a reasonable start.(Applause).GINGRICH: Two hours after the Inaugural Address — that was just the hors d'oeurve. We haven't got around to serious work, yet.After the Inaugural Address, I will spend it signing executive orders and presidential findings. All of them will have been published by October 1. The country will know precisely what this campaign is about. The very first executive order will abolish all of the White House czars, as of that moment.(Applause).GINGRICH: We will sign, that day, an executive order, which as of that moment, approves of the Canadian pipeline to Houston, period.(Applause).GINGRICH: My message to Prime Minister Harper and the Canadian government is simple: You do not need a partnership with the Chinese. Give the American people a few months. When we beat Obama on election night, you can start buying equipmentbecause we will approve it on January 20th.(Applause).GINGRICH: There will be an executive order to move the State Department, to put the embassy in Jerusalem as of that day, period.(Applause).GINGRICH: We will, that day, reinstate Ronald Reagan's "Mexico City Policy" — No money for abortion overseas, period.(Applause).GINGRICH: And we will have an executive order to repeal every act of religious bigotry by the Obama administration period.My goal, with your help, is that by the time President Obama lands in Chicago, we will have repudiated at least 40 percent of his government on the opening-day.(Applause).GINGRICH: Let me talk now about how to create jobs: America works when Americans are working. The number one theme of the fall campaign will be a "Paycheck President" versus a "Food Stamp President." I believe we will win that fight by a huge margin.(Applause).GINGRICH: I worked with President Reagan, and in his eight years, we created 60 million jobs. I worked with President Clinton, and in those four years, we created11 million jobs and got down to 4.2 percent unemployment. So how do you do it? Really serious change. And I have only one measure for what I'm about to tell you. I want the establishment to understand up front: This is not about fairness. This is not about being revenue neutral, this is about maximizing economic growth to put Americans back to work and to create the most dynamic economy on the planet and to rebuild our manufacturing base, so we can pull away from China and we become once again the dominant country on the planet.(Applause).GINGRICH: So how do you do that?First: You eliminate the capital gains tax, so it is a zero capital gains for all investments in the United States.(Applause).GINGRICH: Second: You go to 100 percent expensing, so all new equipment at every level, farmer factory, doctor, business, all of that gets written off in one year. The goal is to make the American system the most modern, most productive in the world.(Applause).GINGRICH: You also — if you are going to modernize the equipment, you want to modernize the workforce. Unemployment compensation should be changed so that in order to get in employment compensation, you sign up for a business-led training program, so we are modernizing our workforce.(Applause).GINGRICH: Never again shall we pay somebody 99 weeks for doing nothing.(Applause).GINGRICH: In 99 weeks, you can earn an associate degree.(Laughter and applause.)GINGRICH: Think about the total waste of human capability when you teach people to sit at home for 99 weeks, fundamentallywrong and a violation of the Declaration of Independence — that we have the right to pursue happiness.(Applause).GINGRICH: Now if we're serious about manufacturing, we have to eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, which is a job killing agency.(Applause).GINGRICH: We should replace it with a brand-new Environmental Solutions Agency made up of new people, and the number one requirement should be common sense.(Applause).GINGRICH: They should also have to take in to account, economics. The idea that the highest gas prices that we have had — they are looking at a regulation that would raise the price of gasoline $0.25 a gallon — tells you how utterly, totally irrational EPA is today and why we should replace it with a new agency, not try to reform it, because the people in it happen to be self-selected radicals who are antibusiness, anti-local control, and seek to dictate to America.(Applause).GINGRICH: We also need a 21st century Food and Drug Administration whose job is really simple: Get in the laboratory, understand the science, and accelerate getting it to the patient, so we save as many lives as possible, as rapidly as possible, and in the process, we create hundreds ofthousands of new jobs, dominating the world market in healthcare.(Applause).GINGRICH: We need a 12 and a half percent corporate tax rate. That is the Irish tax rate. It makes us tremendously competitive in the world. It brings him $700 billion of profits that are locked up overseas. It enables our companies to compete. And I said to my liberal friends: At 12 and a half percent, General Electric will actually pay taxes.(Applause).GINGRICH: We should abolish the death tax permanently because it is an immoral tax.(Applause).GINGRICH: You know, when Governor Romney released his taxes, the Liberals were shocked. He was only paying 15 percent. Their answer was to raise his taxes. I'm a conservative. I believe our goal should be to get your taxes down to 15 percent.(Applause).GINGRICH: Now, how do you do that? We have in my plan something we got from Hong Kong, care of Steve Forbes. Hong Kong has had for years a two track system: You can keep the current code, all the red tape, all the deductions, all the forms, or you fill in one page — here is how much I earned, here is how many dependents, here is 15 percent. And here's what I want to say to the establishment: They're going to jump up and say this is not revenue neutral. They are right. This is called a tax cut.(Applause).GINGRICH: And I have a simple principle and I want you to understand this; this is going to become a huge argument inside the Republican Party. I worked and helped balance the federal budget for four consecutive years, the only four years in your lifetime. So when people say Gingrich is being irresponsible, none of them have ever balanced the federal budget. We will get a federal budget balanced, but I have a simple principle: My intention is to shrink spending down to the level of revenue, not to raise revenue up to the level of Obama spending.(Applause).GINGRICH: This is a fight we had in 1984 when we put in the no tax increase platform, which I worked with Jack Kemp and Trent Lott and Bob Kasten, against, by the way, the establishment.And our principle was simple: We are not the tax collectors for the welfare state. We are not assigned the job of going out to raise extra money so liberals can give it away. We are, in fact, interested in a tax code that creates jobs, that maximizes freedom, the gives you a chance to take care of your family, your neighborhood, your charities, your church or synagogue, and that is a fundamentally different model than the establishment model, which is oriented towards government.And we will not tax the American people for Barack Obama's credit card.(Applause).GINGRICH: Now, how do you get to a balanced-budget then? You cut spending, you cut taxes to maximize economic growth, you reform government, and you use American energy. At 4.2 percent unemployment, which was the rate when I left office, social security is safe for generation, a huge increase in revenue, and a big decline in cost. You take people off of food stamps, off of Medicaid, you take them off of public housing, off of unemployment, off of welfare. You put them to work paying taxes. The government gets were more revenue without a tax increase. The government spends less. It is the first big step in balancing the budget.(Applause).GINGRICH: But let's talk about cutting spending: And this is what I mean by bold proposals, which will probably be labeled "unrealistic." We should replace the 130-year-old civil service system and its regulations with a new model of modern management using systems like Lean Six Sigma. And we should be prepared to save $500 billion a year in the operation of federal government and increase the economy by at least two trillion dollars a year by the simple elective of having the government cease to be incompetent, and efficient, and a hindrance to the future of the American system.(Applause).GINGRICH: We should look at cutting spending by looking at every single agency. And we should start by abolishing the Department of Energy, which has been a total failure since it was founded.(Applause).GINGRICH: We should apply the system of American Express, MasterCard, Visa to cutting out fraud. We can save 60 to $110 billion a year in Medicaid and Medicare alone by going to a modern system that works. That is almost a trillion dollars a decade just in that one zone. We should apply the Tenth Amendment — I'm delighted that Governor Perry has agreed to develop a project for this summer, for a contract this fall, and for a bill in January, a Tenth Amendment implementation to return power back home.(Applause).GINGRICH: We also have things on energy. I believe that we have an obligation to open up the American system to produce the maximum amount of oil and gas for three reasons: Keeping the 500 or $600 billion a year at home strengthens our economy.If we maximize production, our goal should be to get back to $2 a gallon gasoline to prove to the American people that the free market works in a practical way that affects your life.(Applause).GINGRICH: Now, this isn't pie in the sky. This is pure supply and demand. When you realize that North Dakota alone has 25 times as much energy as the US geological survey thought eight years ago, 25 times as much.And we are not allowed to look at Alaska, where we own 69 percent — an area one and a half times the size of Texas. We don't look offshore. I mean Obama has been an anti-American energy president, and every American pays the price every time they go to a gas station.(Applause).GINGRICH: And I have a very simple principle: We want to ensure that no future president ever again bows to a Saudi King, period.(Applause).GINGRICH: We need to move towards a personal Social Security savings account for young Americans and taking Social Security offbudget for senior citizens. And we need to make sure that no politician ever again lies to our senior citizens by threatening to keep from them checks that they earned and that they deservebecause the trust fund is there, even if there is no trust in Barack Obama.(Applause).GINGRICH: We need to have a complete audit of the Federal Reserve to find out every single decision. We deserve to know who got our money and why. If Bernanke has not resigned by the day I am sworn in, I will ask the Congress to pass a law ending his term.(Applause).GINGRICH: And we need a commission on gold and solid currency much like the one Ronald Reagan had in 1981. And I'm delighted that Lou Lehrman and Jim Grant has agreed that they are willing to serve as the chairmen. Let me close on two big topics that are very, very important about the economy:First: This administration is waging war on religion, but so are the courts. This is why we need a movement that is bigger than just beating Obama. We need a movement that understands we're going to change the Congress, the White House, the bureaucracies, and where necessary, the courts. And we all need to understand how real this is. This country was founded by people who came here in order to avoid religious persecution. The very basis of this country was religious liberty. Our core document says we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. And Barack Obama seeks to cut across those, and I frankly don't care what deal he tries to cut, this is a man who is deeply committed. If he wins reelection, he will wage war on the Catholic Church the morning after he is reelected. We cannot trust him, we know who he really is and we should ensure the country knows who he really is.(Applause).GINGRICH: For those of you who don't understand what a real bold solution approach is — if you go to Newt.org there is a 54 page paper that Vince Haley and I put together over a nine-year period that outlines how to rebalance the judiciary and how to reestablish the right of the people to protect themselves against dictatorial judges who are rewriting the Constitution rather than enforcing the Constitution. It is a very serious topic.Finally, this is an administration which lies about who our enemies are, refuses to tell the truth about what threatens us, is blind to the dangers we are running, seeks to weaken radically our defense system, has crippled our intelligence system, and is making a series of decisions around the world that are stunning in theirmisunderstanding of the nature of reality. Today, we have Americans held hostage in Egypt, precisely like Jimmy Carter with hostages in Iran in 1979, 1980. Today, we have the person who helped us find bin Laden — has been arrested by the Pakistani government. Now what more do you need to know? They did not say, "Oh this is terrific. You helped find the most wanted terrorist in the world." They said, "This is terrible. How could you help the Americans?"We need a profound national debate about our entire policy, and it needs to start by telling the truth about radical Islamists who seek to kill us.(Applause).GINGRICH: This is going to be — this is going to be a big choice, big decision election. I think — while I'm seeking the Republican nomination, it has to be an American campaign. We want to say to every American — if you favor paychecks over food stamps, come join us, no matter what your background, no matter where you live. We want to be with you in creating a work oriented jobs economy. We want to say to every American: If you believe that honesty about our enemies, strengthening our defense, and competence in ourbeliefs is vital to our survival, come join us. We don't care who you once were. We don't care what you once did. We need every American who wants to defend America to come together for this campaign. And finally, we need to say to every American: If you believe in the Declaration of Independence, you believe in the Constitution, and you believe in the Federalist papers, then we want you to be with us. We understand others will be with Saul Alinsky, Barack Obama, and radicalism. But everybody who believes that we are endowed by our Creator, that our rights are unalienable, that we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, we want you to come from every background in every community of the country.I need your help. I hope you will go to Newt.org. I hope you'll sign up. We are running a people campaign. We don't have the scale of money that some of our competitors do, but we do have a plan. We are gathering together a team. We have a conservative dream team of people like Governor Rick Perry, Herman Cain, Fred and Jeri Thompson, Todd Palin, Chuck Norris, JC Watts, Kellyanne Conway, Linda Upmeyer, Oliver North, a tremendous team.But in the end, we need you. If we can be together, the many people — we love more names — go to Newt.org and add more names —I mean this — all the years I have worked in this party — this is the year to reset this country in a decisive, bold way. We need to teach the Republican establishment a lesson. We are determined to rebuild America, not to manage its decay. And with your help, that is what we will do. Thank you, good luck, and God bless you.(Applause). TrascriptI'm Newt Gingrich and I want to report to you that if we unleash the American people, we can be at the beginning of an extraordinary era where we rebuild the America that we love.Now, when I say unleash the American people, I mean literally get the government to stop crippling our efforts to create a better future. This is a big topic. It is one I am going to come back to again and again, in the next few weeks. But I want to start with a part of it that relates to national security, relates to your personal family budget, relates to the economy, and relates to balancing the federal budget, all four in one topic.And it comes down to a simple idea: What if we had a program that enabled the American people to develop so much new energy that we were, in fact, no longer reliant on Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran. We didn't care what the Iranians did in the Strait of Hormuz because we were safe, in national security terms.What if that new energy program created well over a million new jobs, high-paying jobs, jobs that put Americans back to work and kept the money here at home that we had been sending overseas, giving us a dramatic improvement in our balance of payments, strengthening the dollar and giving us a chance to live much freer and more independently?What if that very idea also meant that we'd have dramatic increases in federal revenue in the government without a tax increase but that, in fact, the federal government would have literally an entire new stream of money?And finally, what if that big new idea meant that you personally were better off because you are buying gasoline for $2.50 a gallon, not for $3.89 or $4 as what some people project by the summer could be $5 or more? How is that possible, you ask? Well, that is what is exciting, and that is one of the reasons I'm running for president. I know that science, technology, entrepreneurship have made tremendous progress. And I know that the politicians in Washington, the old-time establishment, the elite news media, the bureaucrats don't have a clue what's possible, or in some cases, they have a clue and they are opposed to it. And I want to cover both of those in the next few minutes. But let's start with a historic fact that I think is going to change our understanding of America's future and our understanding of the energy possibilities.That fact is called North Dakota. In North Dakota, there is a formation called the Bakken formation. It has a tremendous amount of oil. It has much more oil than the US geological survey used to think. In fact, based on one US geological survey study, there is now 25 times as much oil as there was back when they first estimated it, not 25 percent more, 2500 percent more.Now, the reason we know this is, I think, very illustrative of what is wrong with America. We know the Bakken formation exist in North Dakota because it is on private land, and liberals weren't able to block us from developing it. So the people, the entrepreneurs, the business leaders who went in and developed that formation, they began to produce more and more oil. As one of them said, "They now find that almost everywhere they look, there is more oil."What's the result? Well, the official unemployment rate in North Dakota is 3.5 percent, but that may actually be misleading because most of that 3.5 percent don't have the right training. It turns out that North Dakota's booming to such an extent that there is 16 to 18,000 new job, good jobs, 60,000 to 80,000 dollar-a-year jobs that aren't filled because the folks who need a job aren't trained, and the folks, the jobs they need, don't have people filling them.Think about that. What would that be like in your hometown if the boom was so big that there were 16 to 18,000 unfilled jobs? How much better off would we be? And guess what? When you have that kind of economic growth, you have an increase in revenue to the government. So the State government of North Dakota has had seven consecutive tax cuts, and it now has a rainy day fund of several billion dollars, even though the entire state budget is only about $2 billion.So energy can lead to a bigger economy, more revenue for the government, better jobs for people. Now let's step all the way back and look at the other 49 states and look at the ocean around the United States. If North Dakota has that much energy, how much do we think we have everywhere else? Turns out, we may have more oil in the United States today, given new science and new technology than we have actually pumped worldwide since 1870. We may, in fact, by one estimate have three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia. And remember, right now I am just talking about oil which were relates directly to gasoline, but there has been a parallel revolution in natural gas.In the natural gas, we knew that technically there was a lot of gas in shale, but we did not know how to get it out. And people thought given the amount that could be recovered, as recently as the year 2000, they thought that natural gas was a declining commodity. It was a perfect example of what has been called "Peak Production"; we have already used up over half of it. In fact, as recently as about 2000, people thought there was about seven years supply left. They were literally talking about getting liquefied natural gas out of the Middle East, putting it in giant refrigerator ships, bringing it to the US, unloading it here, because the chemical industry, in particular, needed the gas.All of a sudden, somebody had a really bright idea. They took a technology which had been developed for ocean drilling, because ocean platforms are really expensive, and so when you drill one rig on the ocean platform, you want it to go as many places as you can. So they developed really brilliant techniques for going out horizontal. They come down with one, and then it goes out in every direction. And all of a sudden somebody figured out, gee, if you could do that with natural gas and at the same time, if you could fracture the rock in a way by using steam and water that you could actually get the gas to come into one collection point, you could get a lot of gas out of the shale.The net result was that we now have in shale tremendous amounts of natural gas that is recoverable. In fact, the most recent estimate is that we may have over a hundred year's supply of natural gas. Think about that. In one short decade, we went from seven years supply to over a hundred years supply because science and technology had improved so much. Furthermore, instead of us importing liquefied natural gas from the Middle East, there is now serious talk that we're going to build facilities in Houston, and we're going to ship liquefied natural gas to China.So we will be making money exporting natural gas where people thought we would be giving up money 10 years ago importing natural gas. Now, what does this mean? It means in places like the Marcellus Shale in Western Pennsylvania, in the areas of eastern Ohio, cutting down all along the Appalachians, all the way out to Dallas, Texas, there is formation after formation after formation. And the result is not just money for big oil, but people who own the property, farmers. I have talked several years ago with Governor Jindal of Louisiana who just had run into a farmer who suddenly discovered that he had natural gas on his farm and he had been given an amazingly big check by the natural gas company, and do so he was very happy to find out that he had a better income, he was going to get royalties, and therefore, the local economy around Shreveport was really beginning to grow.Now, I give you that background because these new sciences, these new technologies and the entrepreneurs who use them are giving us dramatic new opportunities. This really matters for some very practical reasons. First of all, since the mid-1970s, we've known that the Arab states and Iran combined have dominated oil production and have used their leverage to raise the cost of oil and to bring political pressure to bear on the Americans and on the Europeans.Now, I want to get to a point where we produce so much oil in the United States that no American president will ever again bow to a Saudi King. I thought, frankly, it's time that we tell the Saudis the truth: We know that they are the largest funders of schools called madrassas, which teach hate. We know that they spend several billion dollars a year exporting a very, very extreme version called Wahhabism, and we know that they are not straight with us.And up until now, our presidents have been too cautious to say, "Oh gee, I don't want to offend the Saudis. I don't want them to do something with their oil supply." Well, we have an opportunity now to turn that around. We have an opportunity to build up the American oil supply, the American natural gas supply, so we can then tell the Saudis the truth, so we can deal with them from a position of strength, so we can no longer worry about the Persian Gulf. And at that point, if, in fact, the Iranians want to do something with the Straits of Hormuz, maybe the Chinese have a problem or the Indians have a problem or the Europeans have a problem. But I am not sure at that point that the Americans will have a problem if we become once again what we were in World War II, the leading producer of oil in the world.And, in fact, there is at least one study already out there says by 2017 if we do the right things, we will produce more oil than either Russia or Saudi Arabia, and we will regain, by the end of the decade, being the leading producer of oil in the world. What I want to do is accelerate that for a couple of reasons: First of all, to get this economy back on track. If you had $500 billion a year that was not going overseas, that was paying royalties in the US, paying landowners, paying people to go out and develop the oil, pain in the pipeline builders, you would suddenly have a really booming economy right here at home. We have an opportunity to really help our economy.There is a second part: Every time gas prices go up, they are the equivalent of a tax on working Americans and retired Americans. Think about it: You go to the gas station. If you are paying $4 a gallon, you have a lot less money left each week than if you are paying $2.50 a gallon. Now $2.50 may sound like it is an impossible number, but that's baloney. When I was Speaker of the House, we paid $1.13 on average during the four years that I was speaker. When Barack Obama became president, we paid $1.89 that week. But the Obama administration is so anti-oil, so anti-gas, so anti-fossil fuels in general, including coal that basically their view is: If we have lots of fuel, they don't want it. They are prepared to do almost anything to stop the development of these kinds of programs. You may think I'm exaggerating, but let me give you an example.In North Dakota where the developments are on private land, so the liberals have not been able to stop them, the Obama US attorney for North Dakota filed a lawsuit because eight migratory birds had been found dead near oil fields. Now I want you to think about this: Thousands of migratory birds are killed every year by wind turbines. But wind turbines are one of President Obama's favorite alternative fuels, so they are green. Therefore, although they kill birds, they are green so they are good even though what they are doing may not be good. And I happen to think wind is a legitimate source of energy, and I have noticed often, for example, that Iowa produces 20 percent of its electricity from wind, the second larger producer in the world after Denmark. So I am not anti-wind, but I think it is fascinating: The selective prosecution of oil companies over eight birds because the ideological radicals in the Obama administration so deeply dislike using oil.You have the same challenge with the way in which we now fracture — called "fracking" — and the Obama administration has literally assembled multiple agencies to hold workshops to try to figure out how to stop it. It is almost as though anything which succeeds, anything which enables Americans to have a better life with more income, with less expensive energy is somehow bad.To show you how far this is going: Even though we have today the highest price average cost of gasoline in history. That's right, President Obama has taken us from $1.89 to the most expensive gasoline on average we have ever had. They are still not satisfied. The Environmental Protection Agency under President Obama has a proposal for a brand-new regulation that would, on average, raise the cost of gasoline another $0.25.And that is still not enough: Secretary of energy, Secretary Chu, who in many ways ought to be called the secretary of anti-energy said before he was named Secretary, "He really wanted American gasoline prices to reach the European level." That would be $9 a gallon.Now you have two be somebody who does not understand America if you think the people who live in a state like Montana, Washington State, Idaho, Minnesota, for that matter Michigan. Look at the distance you drive from Detroit to go up to Mackinac Island or to go to the Upper Peninsula. Look at the distance you drive in Arizona or in my home state of Georgia, the largest state east of the Mississippi, the distance from Atlanta to Sea Island or the distance from Albany up to North Georgia, to Dalton. I think there are a lot of academic liberals, and Dr. Chu is one of them, who live on a nice campus and they live will bicycle to their lab. They have no idea how the average American works. And frankly, he is a good case for abolishing the Department of Energy. We have had one since Jimmy Carter created it after the oil shock, and it does not work very well. It has, I think, hurt the entire process of finding energy. With investors like Solyndra, it is open to charges of corruption.I think we would be much better off to abolish the Department of Energy and create the right rules and the right approaches. Now let me give you some examples of what I mean by that. Under President Obama, because he is so anti-American energy, we have actually had a 40 percent reduction in development of oil offshore, and we have had a 40 percent reduction in the development of oil on federal lands. This is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. What we should do and what I will do as your president is I will authorized the development of offshore, as long as it is far enough out that it is not visible, and it is not a threat to tourism or the fisheries. And I will authorize the development of federal lands that are appropriate. And think about this: We own — we, the American people, own 86 percent of Nevada. That's an area 40 percent the size of Texas. And mining is the second-largest employer in Nevada. If the Federal Government were more willing to open up parts of Nevada, we would have a lot more jobs. We own 69 percent of Alaska. Alaska is, in fact, twice the size of Texas. That means we own one and a half Texases. So you can offer the environmentalist half of Texas, 125,000 square miles. They can take national parks, polar bear areas, walrus areas, glaciers, an area half the size of Texas.That would leave us for development for looking for oil, for gas, for coal, for minerals, an area literally the size of Texas that is currently undeveloped.So when I suggest to you with the new technologies, with the new ability to have very sophisticated seismic exploration to target where the reservoirs of oil and gas are, with the ability to go out and have very sophisticated and efficient methods of going down and finding them, we could have an explosion of new energy, news sources, and new capacity.There's no reason we cannot set three goals: Become energy independent for national security reasons;Develop enough new energy here at home that would create well, over a million jobs in the next few years, high-paying jobs, very useful jobs, jobs which by the way, increase our manufacturing base because much of energy production requires manufacture products in order to both drill, due process, to transport;Third, by using federal property and by allowing offshore development on federally controlled waters, we get paid a royalty. One of the leading experts on North Dakota has suggested that we might well have over the next generation 18 trillion, not billion, $18 trillion in royalties that we could gather for the federal government with no tax increases.And in fact to accelerate that, I propose the following tax changes. I propose we go to zero capital gains tax, so hundreds of billions of dollars pour into the United States to enable us to have new investment, new factories, new exploration, new companies. I suggest a 12 a half percent corporate tax rate would liberate about $700 billion in overseas profits to bring them back home to be reinvested and to allow our companies to compete everywhere in the world. I've also proposed that we abolish the death tax permanently, so that we are in a position where family businesses can focus on job creation and are being successful, not on hiding from the IRS.I've also proposed that we have 100 percent expensing. And what that means is: When you invest in new equipment, you write it off in one year. Now that is really important because it means if we are going to go out and find new oil, we're going to move the oil with pipelines, we could make it very desirable to develop energy in America and to develop manufacturing in America, so that the energy companies would be buying from American manufacturers. And you would, once again, rebuild our machine tool industry and rebuild our industry that supplies goods and services.I was in a company that makes forklifts, Xtreme Manufacturing, in Las Vegas, Nevada, and they were looking forward to the Keystone Pipeline because they were building the forklifts in Nevada that were going to be used to build the pipeline. So there are jobs all over the country dating back into this reemergence. I guarantee you that as your president on the very first day; I will sign an executive order approving the Keystone Pipeline so that oil can come from Canada through the United States to Houston and Galveston. That way we will have 30 to 50,000 new jobs building the pipeline, and for the next 50 years, we will have people working to maintain the pipeline; we will have people working to process and refine the all products and to ship them out of the ports of Galveston and Houston.It is a win-win program. I am dedicated to making sure that the Canadians do not have to have a partnership with China to build a pipeline due west across the Rockies. I want them to have the less expensive, more effective, and frankly, more pro-American pipeline that comes right down to Houston and enables us to make money with our Canadian neighbors in a way that is positive for both countries and helps us increase our national security. So these are very practical steps we can take.A president who is willing to replace the environment protection agency with a brand-new environmental solutions agency dedicated to common sense, to science and technology, to innovation and to be economically rational. A president dedicated to opening up offshore so that we can develop the maximum amount of American oil and gas right here at home. A president willing to use federal land where appropriate, not national parks, not areas of great beauty, but we have millions of acres that we can allow to be developed in a way that will be good for America, good for our economy, good for our national security. A deliberate strategy to bring down the price of gasoline to $2.50 a gallon or less so that you can afford to buy the kind of car you want. And remember, once we prove there is no "Peak Oil," once we prove that, in fact, there is a huge volume of energy out there that we can develop if we are willing to do it, there is no reason to have CAFE standards. CAFE Standards were adopted for automobiles as a response to the Arab embargo in the 1970s. But if we're going to produce plenty of energy, let the American people by the car or truck they want. We don't need this meddlesome Washington bureaucracy and Washington politicians dictating to the rest of us what we should do and how we should live. People, if they go to work and they earn a living and they pay their taxes, when it is their take-home pay, it ought to be their decision. And they ought to have the freedom to drive what you want to and they ought to have the freedom to enjoy the things they want to enjoy. And they should not be told by some Washington bureaucrat or some Washington politicians what they have to do. And frankly, if we eliminate the CAFE Standards, all of our auto companies are going to be healthier overnight. The American people replied to bureaucratic meddling by moving from full-size cars when they were outlawed to trucks. So the effect wasn't to have us go to smaller vehicles, it was just to shift us out of cars into trucks. And I think we need to understand the American people really are proud about their right to choose the way they want to live without politicians and bureaucrats telling them what to do. And I will say finally, if we do all of this, the amount of money we are going to generate is going to enable us to move towards a balanced budget, if we control spending, if we modernize the Federal Government, if we adopt anti-fraud procedures, if we abolish a couple of departments. If we take the Tenth Amendment project that Governor Rick Perry has agreed to head up, and we return power back to state and local government. Those things will enable us to move back toward a balanced budget. I know this can be done, because when I was Speaker of the House, I worked with President Bill Clinton and passed the 1997 Balanced Budget Act and out of that came four consecutive balanced budgets. We paid off $405 billion in debt.So when I look at the scale of the Obama deficit, the amount of money he is throwing away, the wasteful use of his credit card, I know that we can do better. And I know that if we open up American energy, think about the things that happen simultaneously.We get a lot more jobs, that is, people that come off of unemployment, they come off of food stamps, they come off of welfare, they come off of public housing, they come off of Medicaid. All that saves us money. And they go to work taking care of their family and paying taxes. So government revenue goes up, government expenses go down.Second, I know that when we develop this, the companies are going to make more profit, so they are going to pay more taxes back. And I know that the royalties that we are going to get from federal land and from offshore developments is going to pour in by the billions. In fact, if the estimates from North Dakota are right, it could literally be pouring in at the rate of $100 billion or more a year of increased royalties without a tax increase. So there are a lot of positive things that can come, all simultaneously.And finally, as a national security matter, it allows us to say to the all developing dictators, whether they are Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Iran, you name it, that we are going to be standing on our own two feet. That the United States is not going to bow to anybody, we are not going to be blackmailed by anybody, and as we get to a balanced-budget, we're going to start paying down our debt, paying off the Chinese held bonds, so that we can become truly once again independent and able to do what we believe in on our terms, without having to deal with the kind of pressure you might get into even if there is somebody holding onto your oil or because they're holding onto your U.S. Treasury notes. Either one is a form of leverage over us and weakens us. I believe it is very important that we take advantage of this. But notice what my outline for you. Here is a whole new approach. It is positive. It is exciting. It means you will have more money in your pocket because at $2.50 a gallon, you can figure out for yourself what does that save you annually? And if you are a family that has several cars or several trucks, it saves you a lot. If you are an independent trucker, it saves you a whole lot of money. If you live in a town where trucks are bringing your groceries and they are bringing things to your local mall, you are going to save money.Every time you can lower the cost of energy, you make it easier for us to have manufacturing and you lower the cost of living. It is a win-win environment. You also know that if you do this, we have a lot more jobs, and we need a growing economy with a lot of new jobs, because we want to be a country where America works best when Americans are working. We are not a country of food stamps and welfare. We are a country of the work ethic, of a job, of take-home pay, of opening up our own business. And this kind of energy program will do just that. I know it is different. I know a lot of folks in the establishment will say it is "unrealistic." These are the same people who said to President Reagan when he said, "We can defeat the Soviet empire,""Now be reasonable." These are the same people that when Governor Reagan, President Reagan said — first Governor Reagan as candidate, then President Reagan once he won — he said, "If we cut taxes, we will create jobs." They said, "That is "voodoo economics." Well, he created 16 million new jobs during his presidency. I came back really applying the same things in 1994 with the "Contract with America." And people said that is "unrealistic." You are not going to win control of the House. It's not possible. No one has done it in 40 years. You can't balance the budget. You can't reform welfare.Well, guess what? Because we had positive ideas that were real, we had the largest one-party increase in American History; 9 million additional votes in 1990 went to the Republican side, a million fewer votes than the Democratic side. We won control for the first time in 40 years and we kept our word. We, in fact, passed welfare reform; two out of three went to work or went to school. Incomes went up. We had fewer children in poverty because their parents were working and have a better future. We passed the largest tax cut, the largest capital gains tax cut in history. Unemployment dropped to 4.2, 11 million new jobs. And the budget, as I said earlier, was balanced for four straight years. So I believe if you have courage and faith, if you have the right principles and you have the right facts, then you can develop the right policies. And even if it scares the Washington establishment, even if the Liberals don't like it, even if the New York Times editorial writers say "You can't do this? How can you have all that new energy? How can you let the American people buy the kind of car they want? How can you lower the price of gasoline to $2.50?"Well, my answer is: We are Americans. And Americans do what needs to get done. We have a long history of people doing great things together and I believe we can have an energy future together. And I think with that energy future, we're going to have a better quality of life, a better economy, better national security, and take a big step toward balancing the federal budget.I do need your help. This is a wild campaign. It has been up and down; it's like riding the roller coaster at Space Mountain. And I would love to have you come to Newt.org and sign up and help us.We need all the folks we can get because if enough Americans come together, we are going to, in fact, create a much better future. And together, let's get America back on the right track. Let's get the economy growing again. Let's make sure that our national security is safe, and let's give our children and grandchildren the kind of fabulous country that our parents worked and fought to give us. Thank you very, very much. I'm Newt Gingrich and I want to report to you that if we unleash the American people, we can be at the beginning of an extraordinary era where we rebuild the America that we love.Now, when I say unleash the American people, I mean literally get the government to stop crippling our efforts to create a better future. This is a big topic. It is one I am going to come back to again and again, in the next few weeks.But I want to start with a part of it that relates to national security, relates to your personal family budget, relates to the economy, and relates to balancing the federal budget, all four in one topic.And it comes down to a simple idea: What if we had a program that enabled the American people to develop so much new energy that we were, in fact, no longer reliant on Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran. We didn't care what the Iranians did in the Strait of Hormuz because we were safe, in national security terms.What if that new energy program created well over a million new jobs, high-paying jobs, jobs that put Americans back to work and kept the money here at home that we had been sending overseas, giving us a dramatic improvement in our balance of payments, strengthening the dollar and giving us a chance to live much freer and more independently?What if that very idea also meant that we'd have dramatic increases in federal revenue in the government without a tax increase but that, in fact, the federal government would have literally an entire new stream of money?And finally, what if that big new idea meant that you personally were better off because you are buying gasoline for $2.50 a gallon, not for $3.89 or $4 as what some people project by the summer could be $5 or more?How is that possible, you ask? Well, that is what is exciting, and that is one of the reasons I'm running for president.I know that science, technology, entrepreneurship have made tremendous progress. And I know that the politicians in Washington, the old-time establishment, the elite news media, the bureaucrats don't have a clue what's possible, or in some cases, they have a clue and they are opposed to it. And I want to cover both of those in the next few minutes.But let's start with a historic fact that I think is going to change our understanding of America's future and our understanding of the energy possibilities.That fact is called North Dakota. In North Dakota, there is a formation called the Bakken formation. It has a tremendous amount of oil. It has much more oil than the US geological survey used to think.In fact, based on one US geological survey study, there is now 25 times as much oil as there was back when they first estimated it, not 25 percent more, 2500 percent more.Now, the reason we know this is, I think, very illustrative of what is wrong with America. We know the Bakken formation exist in North Dakota because it is on private land, and liberals weren't able to block us from developing it.So the people, the entrepreneurs, the business leaders who went in and developed that formation, they began to produce more and more oil. As one of them said, "They now find that almost everywhere they look, there is more oil."What's the result? Well, the official unemployment rate in North Dakota is 3.5 percent, but that may actually be misleading because most of that 3.5 percent don't have the right training. It turns out that North Dakota's booming to such an extent that there is 16 to 18,000 new job, good jobs, 60,000 to 80,000 dollar-a-year jobs that aren't filled because the folks who need a job aren't trained, and the folks, the jobs they need, don't have people filling them.Think about that. What would that be like in your hometown if the boom was so big that there were 16 to 18,000 unfilled jobs? How much better off would we be?And guess what? When you have that kind of economic growth, you have an increase in revenue to the government. So the State government of North Dakota has had seven consecutive tax cuts, and it now has a rainy day fund of several billion dollars, even though the entire state budget is only about $2 billion.So energy can lead to a bigger economy, more revenue for the government, better jobs for people. Now let's step all the way back and look at the other 49 states and look at the ocean around the United States.If North Dakota has that much energy, how much do we think we have everywhere else? Turns out, we may have more oil in the United States today, given new science and new technology than we have actually pumped worldwide since 1870. We may, in fact, by one estimate have three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia.And remember, right now I am just talking about oil which were relates directly to gasoline, but there has been a parallel revolution in natural gas.In the natural gas, we knew that technically there was a lot of gas in shale, but we did not know how to get it out.

They come down with one, and then it goes out in every direction. And all of a sudden somebody figured out, gee, if you could do that with natural gas and at the same time, if you could fracture the rock in a way by using steam and water that you could actually get the gas to come into one collection point, you could get a lot of gas out of the shale.The net result was that we now have in shale tremendous amounts of natural gas that is recoverable. In fact, the most recent estimate is that we may have over a hundred year's supply of natural gas.

This really matters for some very practical reasons.First of all, since the mid-1970s, we've known that the Arab states and Iran combined have dominated oil production and have used their leverage to raise the cost of oil and to bring political pressure to bear on the Americans and on the Europeans.Now, I want to get to a point where we produce so much oil in the United States that no American president will ever again bow to a Saudi King. I thought, frankly, it's time that we tell the Saudis the truth: We know that they are the largest funders of schools called madrassas, which teach hate. We know that they spend several billion dollars a year exporting a very, very extreme version called Wahhabism, and we know that they are not straight with us.And up until now, our presidents have been too cautious to say, "Oh gee, I don't want to offend the Saudis. I don't want them to do something with their oil supply."Well, we have an opportunity now to turn that around.

We have an opportunity to really help our economy.There is a second part: Every time gas prices go up, they are the equivalent of a tax on working Americans and retired Americans. Think about it: You go to the gas station. If you are paying $4 a gallon, you have a lot less money left each week than if you are paying $2.50 a gallon.

When Barack Obama became president, we paid $1.89 that week.But the Obama administration is so anti-oil, so anti-gas, so anti-fossil fuels in general, including coal that basically their view is: If we have lots of fuel, they don't want it.

Therefore, although they kill birds, they are green so they are good even though what they are doing may not be good.And I happen to think wind is a legitimate source of energy, and I have noticed often, for example, that Iowa produces 20 percent of its electricity from wind, the second larger producer in the world after Denmark. So I am not anti-wind, but I think it is fascinating: The selective prosecution of oil companies over eight birds because the ideological radicals in the Obama administration so deeply dislike using oil.You have the same challenge with the way in which we now fracture -- called "fracking" -- and the Obama administration has literally assembled multiple agencies to hold workshops to try to figure out how to stop it. It is almost as though anything which succeeds, anything which enables Americans to have a better life with more income, with less expensive energy is somehow bad.To show you how far this is going: Even though we have today the highest price average cost of gasoline in history. That's right, President Obama has taken us from $1.89 to the most expensive gasoline on average we have ever had. They are still not satisfied. The Environmental Protection Agency under President Obama has a proposal for a brand-new regulation that would, on average, raise the cost of gasoline another $0.25.And that is still not enough: Secretary of energy, Secretary Chu, who in many ways ought to be called the secretary of anti-energy said before he was named Secretary, "He really wanted American gasoline prices to reach the European level." That would be $9 a gallon.Now you have two be somebody who does not understand America if you think the people who live in a state like Montana, Washington State, Idaho, Minnesota, for that matter Michigan. Look at the distance you drive from Detroit to go up to Mackinac Island or to go to the Upper Peninsula. Look at the distance you drive in Arizona or in my home state of Georgia, the largest state east of the Mississippi, the distance from Atlanta to Sea Island or the distance from Albany up to North Georgia, to Dalton.I think there are a lot of academic liberals, and Dr. Chu is one of them, who live on a nice campus and they live will bicycle to their lab. They have no idea how the average American works. And frankly, he is a good case for abolishing the Department of Energy. We have had one since Jimmy Carter created it after the oil shock, and it does not work very well. It has, I think, hurt the entire process of finding energy. With investors like Solyndra, it is open to charges of corruption.I think we would be much better off to abolish the Department of Energy and create the right rules and the right approaches.Now let me give you some examples of what I mean by that. Under President Obama, because he is so anti-American energy, we have actually had a 40 percent reduction in development of oil offshore, and we have had a 40 percent reduction in the development of oil on federal lands. This is the exact opposite of what we should be doing.What we should do and what I will do as your president is I will authorized the development of offshore, as long as it is far enough out that it is not visible, and it is not a threat to tourism or the fisheries. And I will authorize the development of federal lands that are appropriate.And think about this: We own -- we, the American people, own 86 percent of Nevada. That's an area 40 percent the size of Texas. And mining is the second-largest employer in Nevada. If the Federal Government were more willing to open up parts of Nevada, we would have a lot more jobs.We own 69 percent of Alaska. Alaska is, in fact, twice the size of Texas. That means we own one and a half Texases. So you can offer the environmentalist half of Texas, 125,000 square miles.They can take national parks, polar bear areas, walrus areas, glaciers, an area half the size of Texas.That would leave us for development for looking for oil, for gas, for coal, for minerals, an area literally the size of Texas that is currently undeveloped.So when I suggest to you with the new technologies, with the new ability to have very sophisticated seismic exploration to target where the reservoirs of oil and gas are, with the ability to go out and have very sophisticated and efficient methods of going down and finding them, we could have an explosion of new energy, news sources, and new capacity.There's no reason we cannot set three goals:Become energy independent for national security reasons;Develop enough new energy here at home that would create well, over a million jobs in the next few years, high-paying jobs, very useful jobs, jobs which by the way, increase our manufacturing base because much of energy production requires manufacture products in order to both drill, due process, to transport;Third, by using federal property and by allowing offshore development on federally controlled waters, we get paid a royalty. One of the leading experts on North Dakota has suggested that we might well have over the next generation 18 trillion, not billion, $18 trillion in royalties that we could gather for the federal government with no tax increases.And in fact to accelerate that, I propose the following tax changes. I propose we go to zero capital gains tax, so hundreds of billions of dollars pour into the United States to enable us to have new investment, new factories, new exploration, new companies. I suggest a 12 a half percent corporate tax rate would liberate about $700 billion in overseas profits to bring them back home to be reinvested and to allow our companies to compete everywhere in the world. I've also proposed that we abolish the death tax permanently, so that we are in a position where family businesses can focus on job creation and are being successful, not on hiding from the IRS.I've also proposed that we have 100 percent expensing. And what that means is: When you invest in new equipment, you write it off in one year. Now that is really important because it means if we are going to go out and find new oil, we're going to move the oil with pipelines, we could make it very desirable to develop energy in America and to develop manufacturing in America, so that the energy companies would be buying from American manufacturers. And you would, once again, rebuild our machine tool industry and rebuild our industry that supplies goods and services.I was in a company that makes forklifts, Xtreme Manufacturing, in Las Vegas, Nevada, and they were looking forward to the Keystone Pipeline because they were building the forklifts in Nevada that were going to be used to build the pipeline. So there are jobs all over the country dating back into this reemergence.I guarantee you that as your president on the very first day; I will sign an executive order approving the Keystone Pipeline so that oil can come from Canada through the United States to Houston and Galveston.That way we will have 30 to 50,000 new jobs building the pipeline, and for the next 50 years, we will have people working to maintain the pipeline; we will have people working to process and refine the all products and to ship them out of the ports of Galveston and Houston.It is a win-win program. I am dedicated to making sure that the Canadians do not have to have a partnership with China to build a pipeline due west across the Rockies.I want them to have the less expensive, more effective, and frankly, more pro-American pipeline that comes right down to Houston and enables us to make money with our Canadian neighbors in a way that is positive for both countries and helps us increase our national security. So these are very practical steps we can take.A president who is willing to replace the environment protection agency with a brand-new environmental solutions agency dedicated to common sense, to science and technology, to innovation and to be economically rational.A president dedicated to opening up offshore so that we can develop the maximum amount of American oil and gas right here at home.A president willing to use federal land where appropriate, not national parks, not areas of great beauty, but we have millions of acres that we can allow to be developed in a way that will be good for America, good for our economy, good for our national security.A deliberate strategy to bring down the price of gasoline to $2.50 a gallon or less so that you can afford to buy the kind of car you want.And remember, once we prove there is no "Peak Oil," once we prove that, in fact, there is a huge volume of energy out there that we can develop if we are willing to do it, there is no reason to have CAFE standards. CAFE Standards were adopted for automobiles as a response to the Arab embargo in the 1970s. But if we're going to produce plenty of energy, let the American people by the car or truck they want.We don't need this meddlesome Washington bureaucracy and Washington politicians dictating to the rest of us what we should do and how we should live. People, if they go to work and they earn a living and they pay their taxes, when it is their take-home pay, it ought to be their decision. And they ought to have the freedom to drive what you want to and they ought to have the freedom to enjoy the things they want to enjoy. And they should not be told by some Washington bureaucrat or some Washington politicians what they have to do.And frankly, if we eliminate the CAFE Standards, all of our auto companies are going to be healthier overnight. The American people replied to bureaucratic meddling by moving from full-size cars when they were outlawed to trucks. So the effect wasn't to have us go to smaller vehicles, it was just to shift us out of cars into trucks.And I think we need to understand the American people really are proud about their right to choose the way they want to live without politicians and bureaucrats telling them what to do.And I will say finally, if we do all of this, the amount of money we are going to generate is going to enable us to move towards a balanced budget, if we control spending, if we modernize the Federal Government, if we adopt anti-fraud procedures, if we abolish a couple of departments. If we take the Tenth Amendment project that Governor Rick Perry has agreed to head up, and we return power back to state and local government. Those things will enable us to move back toward a balanced budget.I know this can be done, because when I was Speaker of the House, I worked with President Bill Clinton and passed the 1997 Balanced Budget Act and out of that came four consecutive balanced budgets. We paid off $405 billion in debt.So when I look at the scale of the Obama deficit, the amount of money he is throwing away, the wasteful use of his credit card, I know that we can do better. And I know that if we open up American energy, think about the things that happen simultaneously.We get a lot more jobs, that is, people that come off of unemployment, they come off of food stamps, they come off of welfare, they come off of public housing, they come off of Medicaid. All that saves us money. And they go to work taking care of their family and paying taxes. So government revenue goes up, government expenses go down.Second, I know that when we develop this, the companies are going to make more profit, so they are going to pay more taxes back. And I know that the royalties that we are going to get from federal land and from offshore developments is going to pour in by the billions.In fact, if the estimates from North Dakota are right, it could literally be pouring in at the rate of $100 billion or more a year of increased royalties without a tax increase. So there are a lot of positive things that can come, all simultaneously.And finally, as a national security matter, it allows us to say to the all developing dictators, whether they are Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Iran, you name it, that we are going to be standing on our own two feet. That the United States is not going to bow to anybody, we are not going to be blackmailed by anybody, and as we get to a balanced-budget, we're going to start paying down our debt, paying off the Chinese held bonds, so that we can become truly once again independent and able to do what we believe in on our terms, without having to deal with the kind of pressure you might get into even if there is somebody holding onto your oil or because they're holding onto your U.S. Treasury notes.Either one is a form of leverage over us and weakens us.I believe it is very important that we take advantage of this. But notice what my outline for you. Here is a whole new approach.It is positive.It is exciting.It means you will have more money in your pocket because at $2.50 a gallon, you can figure out for yourself what does that save you annually? And if you are a family that has several cars or several trucks, it saves you a lot. If you are an independent trucker, it saves you a whole lot of money. If you live in a town where trucks are bringing your groceries and they are bringing things to your local mall, you are going to save money.Every time you can lower the cost of energy, you make it easier for us to have manufacturing and you lower the cost of living. It is a win-win environment. You also know that if you do this, we have a lot more jobs, and we need a growing economy with a lot of new jobs, because we want to be a country where America works best when Americans are working.We are not a country of food stamps and welfare. We are a country of the work ethic, of a job, of take-home pay, of opening up our own business. And this kind of energy program will do just that.I know it is different. I know a lot of folks in the establishment will say it is "unrealistic."These are the same people who said to President Reagan when he said, "We can defeat the Soviet empire,""Now be reasonable."These are the same people that when Governor Reagan, President Reagan said -- first Governor Reagan as candidate, then President Reagan once he won -- he said, "If we cut taxes, we will create jobs." They said, "That is "voodoo economics." Well, he created 16 million new jobs during his presidency.I came back really applying the same things in 1994 with the "Contract with America." And people said that is "unrealistic." You are not going to win control of the House. It's not possible. No one has done it in 40 years. You can't balance the budget. You can't reform welfare.Well, guess what? Because we had positive ideas that were real, we had the largest one-party increase in American History; 9 million additional votes in 1990 went to the Republican side, a million fewer votes than the Democratic side. We won control for the first time in 40 years and we kept our word. We, in fact, passed welfare reform; two out of three went to work or went to school. Incomes went up. We had fewer children in poverty because their parents were working and have a better future. We passed the largest tax cut, the largest capital gains tax cut in history. Unemployment dropped to 4.2, 11 million new jobs.And the budget, as I said earlier, was balanced for four straight years. So I believe if you have courage and faith, if you have the right principles and you have the right facts, then you can develop the right policies.And even if it scares the Washington establishment, even if the Liberals don't like it, even if the New York Times editorial writers say "You can't do this? How can you have all that new energy? How can you let the American people buy the kind of car they want? How can you lower the price of gasoline to $2.50?"Well, my answer is: We are Americans. And Americans do what needs to get done. We have a long history of people doing great things together and I believe we can have an energy future together. And I think with that energy future, we're going to have a better quality of life, a better economy, better national security, and take a big step toward balancing the federal budget.I do need your help. This is a wild campaign. It has been up and down; it's like riding the roller coaster at Space Mountain. And I would love to have you come to Newt.org and sign up and help us.We need all the folks we can get because if enough Americans come together, we are going to, in fact, create a much better future. And together, let's get America back on the right track. Let's get the economy growing again. Let's make sure that our national security is safe, and let's give our children and grandchildren the kind of fabulous country that our parents worked and fought to give us. Thank you very, very much. TranscriptCALLISTA GINGRICH: Thank you, for that kind introduction and warm welcome. It is great to be here with you. And I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you who have been so supportive of us throughout this campaign. Your heartfelt prayers and encouragement have made our lives richer and our campaign stronger. Over the last few months, this campaign has been wild. We have been on a roller coaster as front runners seem to come and go.One of the things I enjoy most as we campaign across this country is the chance to meet so many wonderful people, to learn about their lives, concerns, and hopes for the future. As I listen and learn, it is evident that most Americans are still optimistic about the future of this country. It's been encouraging to meet so many people who genuinely believe in the greatness of our country and work tirelessly every day to pursue the American dream.Newt and I have engaged in this race because we believe America is at a crossroads and care deeply about the future of our country. Our only opponent is Barack Obama and we are committed to removing him from the White House. [cheers and applause]Newt is the only candidate with the experience and knowledge necessary to rebuild the America we love. He has a successful national record of creating jobs, balancing the budget, and reforming government. Today we need a leader who can clearly articulate why president Obama and his policies are wrong for America. We need a leader who understands that we must contain and defeat our enemies and we need a leader with bold solutions to create a better future for all Americans. I believe that leader is my husband. Please welcome former Speaker of the House and the next president of the United States, Newt Gingrich. [cheers and applause]NEWT GINGRICH: This is a wonderful moment. I had no idea when [Eric Beach] first asked me several months ago to come that it would be such a great opportunity to respond to President Obama's Friday speech on energy. [laughing]And I want to thank the president for the timing of this. [laughing]But I want to start by thanking, first of all, Callista for introducing me and for everything she doing on the campaign, which is a really very exhausting job [applause]I want to thank Michelle Steel, who has been a great state-wide leader for us and I'm thrilled that she has taken the chair of the campaign. [applause]And also by the way, she is not up here, but I want to also mention Teresa Hernandez, who has been a great help with the Latino groups. [Inaudible] I want to thank Michael Reagan, who has been a great friend since his father's administration. We have done so many things over the years. And he and Rush Limbaugh are the two people who became honorary members of the class of 1994. So Michael's been around and doing great things for a long time. [cheers and applause]Finally it is great to have my fellow Georgian here, Herman Cain. He's a remarkable person a remarkable leader. I can think of at least nine positive things to say. [laughing] [cheers and applause]The reason, when Eric first asked me if I could come do this that I wanted to come here even though I knew you would not have your primary until much later is I want to make a clear statement about a Gingrich candidacy. I am running for president. To be president of all the people, to reach out to run a campaign, while I seek the Republican nomination, I want to run an American campaign. [cheers and applause]And an American campaign has to be designed to reach every American to give every American the choice of which future they want and you cannot follow the recent Republican practice of writing off our largest state and imagine that you are going to run an American campaign. [cheers and applause]You have my commitment is that if you help me in your primary, and I do believe that the nominating process that Texas, which is going to come at the end of May, and in California, which is going to come at the beginning of June, are going to be vital. And I think they guarantee coming that late with the two largest states in the country that there will not be any lock down before we get to California. This will still be a very important campaign. [cheers and applause]I want you to know that as the nominee, I will campaign consistently in California. And I think there are five basic themes that will enable us to appeal to the vast majority of Californians. The first that I'm going to be spending a good bit of time on today is choice. There's always a question of choices because in the end it always comes down to choices. If you would like to have a national energy and American energy policy, never again bow to a Saudi King, and pay $2.50 a gallon, Newt Gingrich would be your candidate. [applause]If you want $10 a gallon gasoline, an anti-energy secretary, and weakness requiring us to depend on foreigners for our energy, Barack Obama will be your candidate. [crowd booing]If you think creating jobs and having paychecks is a good future, Newt Gingrich ought to be your candidate. [applause]If you think food stamps and dependency are adequate, Barack Obama ought to be your candidate. [crowd booing]If you believe that America was created based on religious liberty and that no government can come between us and God, Newt Gingrich ought to be your candidate. [cheers and applause]If you believe that the Ninth Circuit Courts' anti-religious bigotry and the Obama anti-religious bigotry are appropriate, Obama should be your candidate. It's that big. [crowd booing]If you believe in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and the Federalist papers, Newt Gingrich ought to be your candidate. [cheers and applause]And if you believe Saul Alinsky radicalism is what ought to replace all that, Barack Obama ought to be your candidate. [crowd booing]Finally, if you believe the world is dangerous and America should be strong, then Newt Gingrich is your candidate. [cheers and applause]If you think the United States is inevitably weak and guilty and we should run around the world apologizing and appeasing, then Barack Obama is your candidate. [crowd booing]And let me say — I for one find it very offensive that the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief faced with a situation in which an Afghan soldier kills two Americans and wounds four others, faced with another situation the last 24 hours when more Americans were killed, I find it very offensive as commander-in-chief that he is apologizing to the Afghans when in fact, he should be demanding an apology from Karzai. [cheers and applause][Crowd cheers Newt! Newt! Newt!]If we are going to have a serious effective policy in the Middle East, one of the pillars of that policy has to be an American energy program that makes us independent of Saudi Arabia independent of Iraq and Iran independent of Venezuela, producing enough oil, not only for the United States but to ensure that should the Strait of Hormuz be closed we frankly wouldn't care. [cheers and applause]I am not a newcomer to the energy issue. In 2008, we launched "Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less." With Sean Hannity's help, we got 1,600,000 signers. The House Republicans picked up the theme. Ultimately, Governor Palin picked up the theme. The fact that is that prior to the collapse of Wall Street, John McCain was ahead by three and Republicans and the House were ahead by five because the Left had no answer on the issue of energy.We wrote a book called, "Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less." And Callista and I madea documentary called, "We Have the Power." And the purpose was really simple: We have the power. We have more than enough energy in United States that we do not have to rely on foreign countries. But we have an anti-American energy government, and anti-American energy bureaucracy, anti-American energy regulations and now, we have a president who has decided to engage us on this issue.After I came out for a program to get to $2.50 a gallon gasoline, Obama decided he had to make a speech on energy. I really hope every American will read his speech in Miami. It is a very revealing speech. It is factually false, intellectually incoherent, deeply conflicted on policy, and in some places just strange. [laughing]But imagine the challenge for Obama. Obama is a genuine left-winger. That is his world. He believes in the stuff. And really what is dangerous about him is not what he doesn't know; it is what he knows that isn't true. He believes in small cars. He believes in an anti-American energy policy. He believes in high prices. He believes in government control. Now, his challenge is he is running for reelection. The American people actually want the car and truck that they like. The American people are pro-American energy by about 79 to the 16. The American people like low prices. The American people believe individual citizens should decide what car they want to buy.So Obama makes this energy speech, but you have to see it in its context. And I think this is what is making it so hopeless for him to go around and pretend that he is for American energy. In 2007 as a Senator, Obama was the only sponsor of a bill which would have eliminated an inventory of offshore oil assets. I want you to think about this. This is part of the Left's great problem today. They really believe in "Peak Energy." They really believe that you know we're going to run out. We have to ration. The government has to be in charge. Jimmy Carter was right. We ought to have gasoline rationing. We ought to do something in some way to make sure we don't use this all up.And their problem is that it's wrong. Now, their fear is if they actually show us how much energy we have, we will actually want the energy. So they want us to not see the energy because then we can't ask for it because we don't have it. And so he literally introduced a bill that was a bill that favored ignorance. And it is fascinating because what North Dakota has done is that it has blown apart their worldview.In North Dakota in the Bakken formation today has 25 times as much oil. That is 2500 percent more oil than they thought. The Bakken formation is now at 3.5 percent unemployment in North Dakota and that overstates the case because they have 16,000 unfilled jobs in oil fields. The people who are unemployed don't have the skills to do the jobs. The people who have the skills, they basically have zero unemployment. And they generated so much revenue for the state government that they have had seven straight tax cuts and they have a multibillion-dollar rainy day fund.Now, all of this just drives the Left crazy. And by the way, there is one reason this was developed. It was on private land and the Obama administration couldn't stop it. [cheers and applause]Now, let me let you understand the framework in which these folks think. Even in North Dakota, and I believe by the way the Judiciary Committee should look in to this, should subpoena documents and should hold hearings. Even though it was on private land, they still decided to harass the oil industry.So the U.S. attorney, Obama's U.S. attorney from North Dakota filed a lawsuit against the oil companies based on eight migratory birds. Now, wind kills about 33,000 birds a year. So wind turbines, they are substantially more dangerous for birds. But wind is green, so it is good; so therefore, it really didn't kill the birds because if it killed the birds, it'd be bad, but it can't be bad because it is good. [laughing]On the other hand, they managed to find eight birds, and they filed a lawsuit. The judge threw it out. It is an egregious abuse of prosecutorial power, and I think the House Judiciary Committee should, first of all, find out the decision documents in North Dakota and then find out if the decision documents of the Justice Department that allowed such an egregious abuse of power.So they really hate the idea that this is all working. But now, remember this is a long history. I'm going to read several things- those of you that know me well — know I usually just speak off the cuff but and I want to share stuff with you that I think is really important.Here in San Francisco, January 2008 during campaign — see an example about the attitude about the price of energy. Quote, quoting Barack Obama, talking to the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board. "Under my plan of cap and trade, electricity prices will necessarily skyrocket and power plants, natural gas, you name it, whenever the plants were, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retro-fit their operations and that will cost money and they will pass that money on to the consumers. So if someone wants to build a coal fired power plant, — it's just that it will bankrupt them because they are not going to be charged the huge amount for all that greenhouse gas that is being lifted."So it is really open. Higher prices are good. They are necessary. Companies will be bankrupt. This is the true Left. They also come up with silly solutions. Now, I am going to get to algae later on. [laughing]And by the way, I am pro-research into algae. I am a very big pro-science guy. I knew a guy in Texas A&M; who is working on algae. And I think someday down the road algae may well be a useful asset, but it is a little bit like Solyndra. The president keeps finding these things, which would work someday if only they worked, but they don't work, but they should work if only they worked. You really feel much better about them working. He doesn't want the things that do work because those things make you feel bad so we can't have the things that do work because he wants to do the things that don't work. [laughing]So here's Barack Obama during the last phase of high gas costs and I was advocating "Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less." And here is what he was advocating. Quote. This is July 30, 2008. "There are things you can do individually to save energy. Making sure your tires are properly inflated." [laughing]"Simple thing. But we can save all the oil that they are talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating your tires." [laughing]"And getting regular tune-ups. You guys can save just as much."Now, you know how weird your worldview is to believe that inflating your tires equals drilling? [laughing]It is a little scary when you have a president that is this out of touch of reality. Let me go on. I recently got in a little bit of trouble with Volt owners because I made the comment that one of things the left doesn't understand is that you can't put a gun rack in a Volt. [laughing]I am not anti-Volt. I am not anti-any particular choice that you make. You should be allowed to drive what you want to drive.But here's — and I first got onto this when Obama went to campaign for the Democratic candidate for the Senate, Teddy Kennedy's seat in the special election. And he did this entire riff on Scott Brown's truck.Scott Brown was campaigning around the state in a pickup truck. And you could tell — you go back and read the speech that Obama gave in Boston just before the election. You can tell he was fixated on this pickup truck and how inappropriate it was to have a pickup. Actually, I used Prius back then because the Volt did not exist. And I said at the time, "Obama doesn't realize you can put a gun rack in a Prius." And you could just tell that this was the Harvard academician at work. He's going 'Why do you need a pickup truck? You could be bicycling to the campus?' [laughing]So you may think I'm making this up. Here is the president in 2011 in Pennsylvania, "I know some of these big guys, they are all still driving their big SUVs, you know, they have their big monster trucks and everything."And there is a certain weirdness to this whole notion. This is a guy who flew in on Air Force One. [laughing]You would think that at some level, he would be secure. People are allowed to have an SUV. And he goes around with an entire fleet of SUVs. Have you ever watched the presidential motorcade? 19 SUVs driving around and then telling you, you shouldn't have one because the Secret Service needs it. [laughing]Some guy made a motion and Obama says, "You are one of them? Well now, here is my point. If you are complaining about the price of gas and only getting 8 miles to the gallon, [laughter] you may have a big family, but it is probably not that big. How many do you have? Ten kids you say?" The guy said he had 10 kids — it was hard to get in a Volt. [laughing]"Ten kids. Well, you definitely need a hybrid." [laughing]Now, this is my point, which I think our friends on the left don't get: We are for freedom. We don't think politicians should dictate to the American people the size of their car or the make of their car or - [cheers and applause]Now, let me walk you through the background inside the administration. In fact, the Speaker, John Boehner, who put this out. And it is really helpful. He took the speech and on late Friday afternoon they put out a step-by-step example. On February 4, 2009: Just months after president Obama anti-energy secretary said quote, "Somehow we have to figure out [how] to boost the price of gasoline to the levels of Europe."I want you to remember this. Obama picked somebody as Secretary of Energy who believes that the natural price of gasoline should be European, which is nine or $10 a gallon.So when they tell you this is all an accident, baloney. This is a deliberate strategy of the Left to punish the American people into driving vehicles they want. [cheers and applause]In February 2009, barely in office, the Obama administration begins scrapping leases for oil shale development and cancels 77 leases for oil and gas production in Utah. Gasoline, at that point, was $1.91 a gallon.In March 2009, ABC news says, "The White House is closely monitoring the expedited Solyndra loan project even as it was delaying new American energy production that would help make us less dependent on foreign energy." Gas at that point was $1.94.Remember, Solyndra was — the last time Obama had an answer to why we didn't need any fossil fuels because rather than the oil companies have the tax break he wanted the money so he could give it out to his friends so that they could run companies that go bankrupt. [laughing]Gas at that time was $1.94 a gallon. The Obama administration in January 2010 announced this new bureaucratic hurdle to American energy production that the Secretary of the Interior Salazar admitted, quote, "Could add delays to the leasing and drilling process." Gas at that point was $2.67 a gallon.March 2010, instead of opening new areas to energy exploration and development, President Obama blocks deep ocean energy production on 60 percent of American outer-continental shelf. And I want you to remember this because in his speech, he explicitly is dishonest with us. President Obama blocks the ocean energy production on 60 percent of America's outer-continental shelf. Gas was $2.80 a gallon.December 1, 2010, the president re-imposes and expands the moratorium on offshore energy production. Gas was $2.86 a gallon.On November 2011, the Obama administration releases a plan for a five-year moratorium on offshore energy production placing quote, "Some of the most promising energy resources in the world off-limits," according to the House Natural Resources Committee. Gas is $3.42 a gallon.January 18, 2012, President Obama rejects the bipartisan Keystone XL pipeline and thus kills more than 20,000 jobs. Gas was, at that point, $3.39 a gallon.Now, I give you all this background before the speech. And of course what happened was his advisers came to him and said, "Great, price of gasoline is rising before we even get to summer when it goes up even more. You had better find a way to be pro-gasoline instead of anti-gasoline." And so, despite this entire background, he decided to go, and he basically gave a speech in Miami, which can be summarized quote, "Why I didn't mean to do everything I did." [laughing]Remember this administration which ran in 2008 on "Yes, We Can" and is going to run in 2012 on "Why We Couldn't". Now, there are parts that I agree with. [applause]I mean, some of the language is wonderful even if said by him; it is a little bit funny. He says, quote, "We don't have the luxury of pretending. We got to look at the facts. Look at the science. Figure out what we need to do."Well, as an historian Mr. President, I take up your challenge. So the next few minutes I'm going to take your speech and we're going to look at the facts.He goes on to say that quote — I want you to think about this now in context of everything else he is going to say later — quote, "We do have in this country limitless sources of energy."Well, if he believes that, why doesn't he unleash the American people to develop the limitless sources of energy that he claims we have? [cheers and applause]He says, and I think this tells you why he is giving the speech; somebody in his political shop came to him and said he had the following quote. "When gas prices go up, it hurts everybody." [laughing]It is true. Gasoline prices affect and diesel prices affect the truckers that delivers the groceries and that affects the agriculture and that affects the cost of manufacturing and that affects the cost of driving to work that affects the cost of grandparents who want to see their grandchildren. Everywhere you turn around.But Mr. President, if you understand that when gas prices go up, it hurts everybody, why have you not fired Chu, who is specifically dedicated to raising the price of gasoline to European levels? [cheers and applause]And he further gets it. He says, quote, "High gas prices are like a tax straight out of your paycheck." So you could think of gasoline prices when you pump your car as the Obama tax. This is the new Obama tax straight out of your pocket. I've just quoted the president's own words.He cites letters. He says he gets letters every day and they pull out some for him to read and last night he happened to read some. Two of them said quote, "I'm not sure I'm going to be able to keep my job if gas prices keep going up so high."Now, first of all, that is probably true. There are probably people who write that. I ran into a lady in Las Vegas who lives in rural Nevada and she said she is now limited to two trips a week because the price of gasoline bites into her family budget.But as I read that and reread that, something occurred to me. He didn't have to be quoting somebody else. Let me read this sentence as though Obama had said it by himself. QUOTE "I'm not sure I'm going to be able to keep my job if gas prices continue to go up." [laughing] [cheers and applause][Crowd cheers Newt! Newt! Newt!]So let me assure you, Mr. President, you are not going to be able to keep your job. [cheers and applause]The president has decides to pick a fight with those of us who believe in drilling. This is almost — I hope you don't mind me saying this. [This is almost Herman Cain quality.] [laughing]He said you can bet that since it is an election year, talking about Republicans, they are already dusting off their three-point plan for $2 gas. And I will save you the suspense . Step one is to drill. Step two is to drill. And then step three is to keep drilling. [cheers and applause]I tell you what. If I hear the president say, "999," I am really going to start worrying about him. But then the President went on to say the following. As an historian, this is a great place for small history lesson to the American people. He says, "We hear the same thing every year. We've heard the same thing for 30 years." He goes on to say a little bit later, quote, "You know we can't just drill our way to lower gas prices."Well, let me give the president a brief history lesson. In 1976, gasoline had reached $2.46 a gallon. By 1980, with Jimmy Carter's failing economic policies, it had gotten to $3.30. You will remember Jimmy Carter had gas rationing. How many of you remember you bought gasoline every other day based on your license plate. Sort of the ultimate government intervention.A good friend of mine Dave Bossie of Citizens United was 13 that year and he remembers so vividly. Every morning his father sent him out back with a screwdriver [laughing]And his job was to change the license plate so that the car could get gasoline that day. [laughing]True story. And I'd tell you this because it is a great test for liberals and conservatives. Ask your friends and neighbors back home. If the government adopts a policy so stupid that 13-year-olds are being taught that they how to cheat, a conservative says we should drop the policy. The liberal says this is proof we need license plate police at every gas station. [laughing]So gasoline prices had gone up despite rationing from $2.46 to $3.33. The first executive order Ronald Reagan signed deregulated gasoline. The Left was panic stricken. The New York Times thought the prices would skyrocket. Within six months it collapsed. In fact, the collapse of oil prices was a major factor in the defeating the Soviet Empire because it strip them of hard currency.By 1988 — remember it is $3.33 when Reagan was sworn in. By 1988 it has dropped to $1.72. Now, Mr. President I know that this math is kind of tricky because there aren't nine zeros behind it. [laughing]But if you start at $3.33 and after eight years of drilling, you are down to $1.72, that pretty well proves that markets work, and that enough incentives will, in fact, lead people to produce enough energy to, in fact, bring down the price. [cheers and applause]Now, at the end of his speech he says quote, "We need to sustain all of the above strategy that develops every available source of American energy, yes, gas oil and gas, but also wind and solar and nuclear and biofuels and more."Well, this is exactly what John Boehner has been campaigning on for four years. I hope the House Republicans in the near future will move an all-of-the-above energy bill and allow the president to support them instead of trying to get Democratic votes for an all-of-the-above energy bill. And we will see whether or not he really meant this, which by the way he didn't, but it is a great line and it is exactly the Republican policy.And it is nice to think that in a moment of panic that Barack Obama would briefly, for a moment, sound like he was a Republican and a conservative. And I just want to point out that he literally was citing with what John Boehner is for.Now, he says, and I think this is very important. If you listen to him he says, quote, "We are not going to transition out of oil anytime soon."Well, that is true, which would imply that in order to bring prices down, you probably need oil. [laughter]He goes on to say, "America is producing more oil today than any time in the last eight years."It's true because of North Dakota and private land, despite the Obama administration, is developing. Now, in fact, on federal land, production is down 11 percent. So in the area he controls, production is down and the area that is that horrid free enterprise stuff where people get rich, production is up. So he now is claiming credit for the area he can't control in order to have us think he is actually for what he opposes. [laughter and applause]And let me give you an example of the depth of the audacity of this administration. He says quote, "Over the last three years, my administration has approved dozens of new pipelines, including through Canada."Now, Mr. President, you know how limited your respect for the intelligence of the American people must be. How could you possibly veto the only major pipeline that matters from Canada, the Keystone Pipeline, and turn around and suggest to us that the fact that we have approved dozens of tiny ones -- this is like saying, "My Navy has 11 new ships; they're all rowboats." [laughter and applause]I mean, how do you deal with a president who is this fundamentally out of touch with being honest? It would be one thing if he said, "Yes, I vetoed the Keystone Pipeline and here is why."But to come and say, "I have approved lots of pipelines, why are you mad at me?"Well, because you did not approve the one that mattered. The Keystone Pipeline is worth 700,000 barrels of oil a day going to Houston. That is how big a deal it is. The Keystone Pipeline ties U.S. and Canada together. This president is driving Canada into a partnership with China in order to build a pipeline due west in Canada to deliver the oil to Vancouver. It is a strategic disaster of the first order.And I commit to you the very first day I am president, immediately after the Inaugural Address, I will sign an executive order, which authorizes construction as of that day. [cheers and applause]The president goes on to say, quote, "We plan to make available more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources." Sounds good.This is letting you know he is a lawyer. He has carefully selected out a phrase, which is totally misleading but technically not inaccurate because what he will tell you is, is that he is talking about that area that they currently -- remember, this is the guy who wanted to abolish the inventory of assets.He is now telling you that in the areas we currently know about that they want to make 75 percent available. What he didn't tell you is under this definition, 85 percent of the offshore acreage is not available.In other words, all the areas you don't know about or are not going to know about because he won't make them available; therefore, he can say to you, "I am doing the stuff that you know about." It is not his fault we don't know about it except he won't let us find out. [laughter]Now, my view is very different. -- I think each state has to make its own decision. I will allow the states to have 50 percent of the royalties, which means Sacramento will start thinking seriously about development.I will tell you for example, that Senator Webb and Senator Warner, Democrats, have a very good bill for Virginia to develop offshore. And I think that you'd find if we open up offshore -- it will be amazing how fast things can be developed.Now, the president goes on to say -- and here I agree with him but he does not get the meaning. Quote, "The single biggest thing that is causing the price of oil to spike is instability in the Middle East; this time around Iran."I agree with him. But the correct American strategic policy is to have a massive all-out effort to develop our oil resources so that Iranians don't matter. [cheering and applause]Let me tell you: The long-term answer is not the U.S. Navy guarding the Strait of Hormuz. The long-term answer is Americans producing their own energy and telling other people, "You may have a problem but we don't. Because we can be the largest oil producer in the world by the end of this decade, bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia. We have vast resources and can produce more oil than any other country in the world." [cheering and applause] [Crowd cheers Newt! Newt! Newt!]One more example that shows how fundamentally dishonest this president is. He says, quote, "We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves."And what is he is referring to is proven current reserves. But let me give you some numbers. Go back to being a historian for a moment. In 1980, we had 30 billion barrels of crude oil. Since 1980, we have pumped 75 billion barrels.And I'm walking you through this. I know this is a fairly lengthy speech, but I think it is in the Reagan tradition of facts. Because I want to start demolishing Obama as a person who systematically misleads the American people and who systematically limits our natural resources. [cheering and applause]These are the facts. In 1980, our proven reserves was 30 billion barrels. Since then, because of advancing technology, because of changing prices, because of entrepreneurship, we have produced 75 billion barrels out of the 30 billion-barrel reserve, and we have more reserve today than we had in 1980. [applause]So if you were being honest Mr. President, what you would say is -- the lesson of North Dakota is, "We have huge volumes."In fact, the technical estimate is that we have 1.4 trillion barrels of potentially recoverable reserves in the United States, depending on technology.That's a trillion, 400 billion barrels; when in 1980, we thought the total reserve was 30 billion. That is the difference.The reason I tell people I am cheerful -- I am a technological optimist. I actually think the Wright brothers work every time I get in an airplane. [laughter]But I also believe we can find new and better ways to get natural gas. We went from a 7-year supply to a 125-year supply because of science and technology. In fact, as we have gone we have dramatically increased supply of oil because of science and technology. So I'm an optimist.So now, the president then goes on to say, quote, "We are taking every possible action to develop safely a near hundred years' supply of natural gas in this country."That is fundamentally misleading. They have a task force of I think eight different agencies trying to figure out how to block fracking, which is the method by which we get natural gas. They are methodically trying to undermine and cripple the natural gas industry, and it is stunningly dishonest for this president to pretend that he favors something that his administration is actively working to undermine. I think that we should be holding him accountable for it. [cheering and applause]He does make a correct point that there will probably be 600,000 new jobs in natural gas by the end of the decade.My only point is terrific. Why don't we try to get all of it in the next two years so we can put Americans to work now, rather than waiting for the next president? This is a very confused speech. We can't figure out if is he for energy and jobs or he is against energy and jobs? And he keeps zigzagging.He also lives in this fantasy world of government subsidies. He says, quote -- talking about fracking and how we get natural gas out of shale. He says, quote, "It was public dollars; public research dollars that over the years helped develop the technologies that companies are right now using to extract oil and natural gas."Now, it is true there was in the 60s a Department of Energy study of whether or not you could use nuclear explosions in depth. And it is also true that there were some projects done in the 70s. However, just to set the record as a historian, fracking begins in Kansas in 1947 and it expands to Oklahoma in 1949. It's done in Canada in the 1950s. And George Mitchell and the private sector are regarded as the pioneers in the development of "fracking."This would be like suggesting that the Air Force invented the airplane and they don't know who these two Wright Brothers are because, after all, they were private sector guys who were just bicycle mechanics, and how could they have invented the airplane when actually, it must have been the Air Force because everything that was good is done by the government. This is the Obama mind-set.Now, the last one he gets into -- it is almost as good as -- it is almost as good or better than inflating tires. [laughter]He explains, "That up to 17 percent of the oil we import for transportation could be algae."Now, I am a scientific optimist. I have a friend at Texas A&M; who is developing algae that eats municipal waste and then uses alcohol as a byproduct, and some point down the road, it will probably be useful.But this is like Solyndra. The president is for any fantasy that doesn't work today as opposed to any practical thing that works today so as to take your money to prop up something which well might work -- Solyndra might work in 30 years. Solyndra might even work in 10 years but it won't work when it's being given venture capital by the Department of Energy.Similarly, I am all for investing. You say you want to do research on algae? Absolutely. Should we look at pilot projects on algae? Absolutely. I think that probably if you did all the algae development we could, by the end of this decade, we could probably be actually fueling, you know, 12 airplanes, 20 airplanes, 30 airplanes.But what are the odds that you're going to ramp up at a commercial price gasoline from algae in the foreseeable future? Not very good.Now, most of us live in the foreseeable future. [laughter]What are the odds that if you actually allow people to drill and if you allow people to build refineries, you could get dramatically less expensive gas in the foreseeable future? Really, really high.So what you have here -- and this is why I wanted to take this time to review this. This is a very revealing speech.You have an intellectual left-winger who lives in a fantasy world in which he fairly cleverly uses language to say things that aren't true that sound good because he knows that if he tells you what he really wants to do, you will defeat him in a landslide.One of our jobs, of course, is to make sure that the American people understand what he really wants to do.The last point I want to make about what he said. He says three or four times, "There are no silver bullets."There is a pen. Big difference.The presidential pen could sign today the approval of the Keystone Pipeline. That is 700,000 barrels a day.The presidential pen could today sign approval to go back to the Gulf of Mexico, and that is about 400,000 barrels a day.The presidential pen could today approve areas of Alaska that we know have oil. That's about a million, two hundred thousand barrels of oil a day.Three signatures we would have 2.3 million barrels a day of additional energy in the United States. Three signatures.So I would say we are not looking for silver bullets. We are looking for presidential leadership.Our choice is between energy independence and never again bowing to a Saudi King and $2.50 gasoline and about $16 trillion in royalties over the next generation; enough you could literally pay off the national debt just with the royalties for the federal government from development with no tax increase, and at least a million new jobs. That is our side.His side is a series of fantasies in which your tax money is thrown away on products that are not commercially feasible, while you pay higher and higher and higher prices, and are coerced into smaller and smaller and smaller vehicles. These are the two futures we are going to campaign on this year.I would ask you to help us. We need your help. If you're on Twitter, you can go to hash mark $2.50 gas. Those of you want to support me and help me, you can go to Facebook or you can go to email and I hope you'll put down three quick things: Newt equals $2.50 a gallon. [cheering and applause][Crowd cheers Newt! Newt! Newt!]And finally, the speech behind the slogan is at Newt.org. And there is a 30 minute outline of making this real. And finally, we are launching a project at Newt.org asking people to give one Newt gallon to the campaign. That's $2.50. We already have 170,000 donors and we thought this was the right price to drive home.I believe $2.50 a gallon versus $10 a gallon will be a major theme from now until the election. And with jobs and paychecks versus food stamps and dependency as a theme, I believe we can win an historic election.Callista and I are thrilled to be here. We do need your help. I do think this is the most important election of your lifetime, and I'm very grateful you have allowed me to outline this fairly complex but, I think, really important case about how far wrong Barack Obama was on Friday and how much right we, together, are about America's future.Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] GINGRICH: You know, this is amazing. [laughter] I hope the analysts in Washington and New York, who spent June and July explaining our campaign was dead...[laughter]... will watch this tonight and learn a little bit from this crowd and from this place. [applause]We survived the national elite's effort to kill us in the summer because of you, because people who said, we are not going to allow the elite to decide who we are allowed to nominate. And so, with your help, thousands and thousands of people came to newt.org. And with your help, we survived the two most difficult months of a career which goes back to August of 1958. And June and July were really hard, and it was precisely because the national elite -- especially in the Republican Party -- had decided that a Gingrich presidency was so frightening that they had to kill it early. But, you, you wouldn't let them do it. [applause]So with your help and the power of large solutions and big ideas and clear communications in the debates, by December, according to Gallup, I was the frontrunner by 15 points, and according to Rasmussen, I was the frontrunner by 21 points, because you believed in the power of ideas, you believed that people can make a difference, that, in fact, Wall Street money can be beaten by Main Street work. [applause]And, of course, at that point, Wall Street money decided that only a relentlessly negative $5 million campaign in Iowa would work, and they did reduce my support from 36 percent to 14 percent in three weeks of unrelenting negativity. And, once again, the media said, oh, I guess this is over, finally. But you all said no. AUDIENCE: No!GINGRICH: And at the very depths of the establishment rejecting it, thousands of more people came to newt.org and signed up. And the result was, by South Carolina, we won a historic victory, carried 43 out of 46 counties. And it was extraordinary. [applause]And I'm pretty sure that tonight we have a number of the South Carolinians who helped us win who are here who came over to help celebrate this great victory. [applause]And at that point, the forces of Wall Street figured out they were in real trouble. And as the New York Times reported later, they held a meeting on Sunday morning after a Saturday night primary, and they said, "We have to destroy Gingrich." One of them was even quoted in the New York Times as saying, "We have to eviscerate him," which I thought was a fairly strong word in a Republican primary. [laughter]I would expect Obama's people to do that. But I thought it was a tad much, having spent my entire career building the Republican Party. And so they piled on $20 million in three weeks of negativity in Florida, and we were still standing. We carried all of north Florida. And, interestingly, everywhere we were, when we won, the vote went up. When Wall Street won, the vote went down, which I think's a pretty bad sign for this fall, if we end up with a Wall Street candidate. At that point, once again, they began to say, well, maybe he's gone. And then, frankly, Senator Santorum did something very clever. He went to three states nobody else was in, and he won them. [laughter]And the news media, once again desperate to prove Gingrich was gone, suddenly said, ah, now we have the person who's going to be the non-Romney. Now, Callista and I looked at each other, Jackie and Jimmy and Kathy and Paul, my two debate coaches, Maggie and Robert...[laughter] [applause]By the way, I would say, for the performance they get out of me, the most underpaid debate coaches in America. [laughter]Although they'll probably talk to me about that later on. I shouldn't have said that. [laughter]But in any event, we looked at each other and we thought, you know, remember when it was Tim Pawlenty who was going to crowd me out? And remember then when it was Michele Bachmann? And then it was our good friend, Herman Cain the first time? And then, for a brief moment, it was Donald Trump almost. [laughter]And then it was our good friend, Rick Perry, then it was Herman Cain the second time, and now it's Santorum. And you just can't quite get across to them: It's all right. There are lots of bunny rabbits that run through. I am the tortoise. I just take one step at a time. [applause]AUDIENCE: Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! GINGRICH: And I have always tried to be very candid. Sometimes it gets me in trouble, but on balance I think it's how I want to live and how I want to do things. And so I said -- I said, at the very peak of, you know, the Santorum surge and all this stuff, if I can't carry my home state, where people know me, I would have no credibility. And I knew the basic Wall Street technique, which was to come in and spend lots of -- how many of you have noticed negative ads?How many of you have noticed the -- the Reagan negative ad that is a total lie, OK? I mean, that's -- that's what we're up against. It's one thing to have lots of money; it's another thing to lie with the money. And so I looked around, I thought, you know, let's go home, and let's test it out. I'll go home. Callista and I crisscrossed the state. Kathy and Jackie were a great help. And I have to say, Governor Deal did a tremendous job and worked very hard. [applause]Herman Cain stepped up to the plate and worked very, very hard. [applause] Todd Palin made phone calls and really helped communicate that there was a candidate who ought to be helped. The fact is, in Tennessee, Fred Thompson was just tremendously helpful. And in Oklahoma, J.C. Watts was extraordinary. [applause]And so we basically put people power up against money power. And as you saw, the very first race they called tonight about 15 seconds after the polls closed. [applause]And so I'm here, first of all, to say thank you to each and every one of you, because you are the reason we survived every effort of the establishment to stop us. [applause]AUDIENCE: Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! GINGRICH: Now, being here at the Waverly brings back many memories. In 1994, this is where we learned that, for the first time in 40 years, there would be a Republican speaker of the House. [applause]And, you know, for that entire campaign, all of the elites thought we were crazy. First of all, we ran a positive campaign. We had a Contract with America. They just thought that was weird. Why -- why would you go to all that trouble? You have all these ideas. [laughter]We didn't spend our time on lots and lots of negative ads. We spent our time communicating hope to the American people. The result was the largest one-party increase in an off-year in American history, because the American people want a chance to have hope again. [applause]So, as Callista said, tomorrow will bring another chapter in the race for the nomination, but it's more than a chapter in the race for the nomination. It's a chapter in a fight for the soul of the Republican Party. It's a chapter in the fight for the very nature of America. It's a chapter defining who we are as a people. And let me be very clear. I believe that I am the one candidate who has the ability to debate Barack Obama decisively...[crosstalk] [applause]AUDIENCE: Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! GINGRICH: And -- and let me be straight. I -- I don't believe the Romney technique of outspending your opponent four- or five-to-one with negative ads will work against Barack Obama, because there is no possibility that any Republican is going to out-raise the incumbent president of the United States. Therefore, you can't follow that strategy. What you have to have is somebody who knows what they believe, understands how to articulate it so it cuts through all the media, offsets the bias of the elite media who are desperate to re-elect the president and has the guts to take the president head-on every single time he's wrong. [applause]UNKNOWN: No TelePrompTer! [laughter]GINGRICH: Well, we run a very frugal campaign, and we couldn't afford one. [laughter] [applause]But I've -- I've already promised that if the president will agree to seven three-hour debates in the Lincoln-Douglas tradition, he can use a TelePrompTer if he wants to. [applause]And I'll get to that in just a second. But I want you to know that, in the morning, we are going on to Alabama. [applause]We're going on to Mississippi. [applause]We're going on to Kansas. [applause]And that's just this week. I was actually in Huntsville this afternoon, starting off our Alabama effort. And I want to say to all of you, any of you who have friends anywhere in the country, if you can e-mail them, if you can post on Facebook something as simple as, "Newt equals $2.50-a-gallon gasoline," if you can go to Twitter and put in #250gas, I mean, we run a very inexpensive, very straightforward, reach-every-single-person campaign. Now, I just want to give you one example of how profoundly different we are both from the other candidates and from the president, one that I would love to debate this president about. And that's the one that a number of you are holding signs for. I want us to have an American energy policy so no president will ever again bow to a Saudi king. [applause]AUDIENCE: Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt! GINGRICH: Now, I want you to imagine the debate this fall. The president was right the other day. He's so nervous about gasoline prices and energy that he's done two major speeches. And I thought today, in one of the most shallow and self-serving comments by a president that I've heard in a long time, he was candid in his press conference. He said, "You know, I'm really worried about higher gas prices because it will make it harder for me to get re-elected." [booing]I did not make this up. It was just nice to know that the president once again has managed to take the pain of the American people and turn it into his own personal problem. [laughter]Now, the fact is, I'd love to debate this president, because when you read these speeches, they are so deliciously incoherent. [laughter]They -- they are the perfect case study of liberalism run amok. The president says, the Republicans have three strategies. Strategy number one is drilling; strategy number two is drilling; strategy number three is drilling. [applause]And I want to say to him, Mr. President, this is one of the rare occasions when I can say: You are right. [applause]But the president had an alternative to drilling. And this is why debating him would be just one of those moments where you could almost sell tickets for charity. [laughter]The president said, we have to be practical; drilling won't solve it. And then he offered his practical solution. Anybody here remember what it was? AUDIENCE: Algae!GINGRICH: Algae. [laughter] Algae. I mean, I think this summer, as gas prices keep going up, one of our campaign techniques should be have people go to gas stations with a jar of algae...[laughter]... and say to people, would you rather have the Gingrich solution of drilling and having more oil? Or would you like to try to put this in your gas tank? [laughter]I mean, you can't -- I'm amazed that "Saturday Night Live" hasn't taken that speech and turned it into a skit. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. [laughter]What made it really intellectually totally incoherent was the president -- literally two pages after he explains that drilling doesn't work -- the president explains that we've had this great breakthrough in natural gas, that we now have, thanks to new technology, over 100 years' supply of natural gas, that, in fact, we're going to create 600,000 new jobs in the next decade out of natural gas. And I am still waiting for one of the reporters at the White House to come out of their comatose "Re-elect Obama" stance and ask the following question: How does the president think we discovered the natural gas? Because, of course, the answer is...AUDIENCE: Drilling!GINGRICH: Right? Now, I -- I came up with a specific proposal to -- to make vivid that there could be a better future in practical terms. So I proposed $2.50 a gallon as our goal. [applause]Now, I have to say, my daughter, Jackie, was off campaigning with Herman Cain, and after two days of campaigning with Herman, she came back to me, and she said, you know, maybe we should change that. Maybe it should be $2.4999. [laughter]And to his credit, Herman said, no, that will not work as a marketing device. Stick with 2-5-0, which -- which he's very good at. So I picked $2.50. And I actually picked it by asking the oil experts, what's a price at which you would have continuous exploration? Because my goal is to have energy independence so we are free of the Middle East. [applause]When the Iranians practice closing the Straits of Hormuz through which one out of every five barrels of oil in the world flow, the short-term answer is the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force. And the ultimatum: that closing the straits would be an act of war and their government would cease to exist. [applause]But the long-term solution is to create American energy independence so we could say to China, India, and Europe: You have a problem in the Straits of Hormuz. We hope you can solve it, but we're not in charge of it. [applause]Now, the fact is that $2.50 is attainable. Governor Romney came to town the other day and said I was pandering by picking it up. And I just want to explain to the governor, no, this is called leading. [applause]Leaders create large goals. Leaders create a vision of a better future. Leaders arouse the American people to go out and do great things. Leaders believe the American people could easily achieve energy independence if the government got out of the way. [applause]So if your friends ask you why we are emphasizing $2.50 and is it practical, first of all, you can tell them to go to newt.org. We have there an entire 30-minute speech which outlines why it is doable and it's practical. I wrote a book called "Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less" back in 2008. Callista and I did a movie called "We Have the Power." I mean, this is clearly doable. But in addition, point out three numbers to them. The price of gasoline when I was speaker was $1.13. The price of gasoline when Barack Obama became president was $1.89. All of this gigantic increase came from his policies. Finally, if you remember the natural gas story the president's so proud of, we have now developed so much natural gas that -- that supply is outrunning demand and the price has fallen from $7.97 to around $2.86. Now, translate that as a percentage decline -- and this is, by the way, with an 11 percent increase in production. They haven't -- they haven't doubled it. They haven't gotten even to 25 percent yet. But an 11 percent increase in production suddenly changed the whole equation of supply and demand. Now, if you had the same experience with oil, you would end up at $1.13, what it was when I was a speaker. So $2.50 is a long way from a radical number; $2.50 is a practical, cautious, doable number. And my goal over the next few weeks is to drive home to every American, we don't have to be trapped in a Department of Anti-Energy. We don't have to be trapped with an EPA which destroys jobs. We don't have to be trapped with a president who refuses to build the Keystone pipeline, refuses to reopen the gulf, refuses to develop Alaska. [applause]With -- with your help -- with your help, we're going to get enough people to come to newt.org and sign up. We have 173,000 donors already; 95 percent of them give less than $250. We have a place where you can actually come in and give one Newt gallon. That's $2.50. [laughter]If you get excited, you can give 10 Newt gallons. That's $25. With your help, we're going to go on to Tampa and win the nomination. [applause] Thank you. Good luck, and God bless you. [applause]
