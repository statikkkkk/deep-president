I'm Jon Huntsman, and I'm humbled. I've been a governor of the great state of Utah. I've been a businessman. I've been a diplomat. I'm the husband of the love of my life, the greatest human being I've ever known, Mary Kaye, for 28 years. I'm the father of seven terrific kids. I'm the son of great parents, who are here with me today, celebrating a very important anniversary, including a birthday.I'm from the American west, where the view of America is limitless with lots of blue sky.I've lived overseas four times, where the view of America from 10,000 miles away is a picture of liberty, opportunity and justice. People secure in their rights and in love with their liberty. People who have done more good for more people than any other nation on earth.And today, I'm a candidate for the office of President of the United States of America.Thank you. Thank you.My kids can't believe I just said that.And I'm asking for the greatest privilege Americans can bestow on a fellow citizen, and you're entitled to know the reasons why.You see today Americans are experiencing, through no fault of their own, something that is totally alien to them - a sense that the deck is stacked against them by forces totally beyond their control. No matter how hard they work, save, and plan, the opportunities are not there for them as that were present for previous generations.Perhaps, saddest of all, we have lost faith in ourselves. For the first time in history, we are passing down to the next generation a country that is less powerful, less compassionate, less competitive and less confident than the one we got.This, ladies and gentlemen, is totally unacceptable and it is totally un-American.And it need not, must not, will not be our permanent condition. We will not be the first American generation that lets down the next generation.We have the power, we have the means, we have the character to astonish the world again by making from adversity a new and better country; this inexhaustible land of promise and opportunity.You see, we have everything a nation could hope for. We have our freedom, we have rule of law, the longest surviving Constitution and our abiding belief in personal responsibility.We have freedom of speech, religion and press.We produce a quarter of the world's GDP.And we are the most productive society on earth.We have the finest colleges and universities, and the most powerful, skilled and selfless armed forces.And we have character; character that made a new world from a wilderness; character that made the desert bloom and the cities rise to the heavens; character that made the world safer, freer, and more prosperous.What we now need is leadership that trusts in our strength. Leadership that doesn't promise Washington has all of the solutions to our problems, but rather looks to local solutions from our cities, towns and states.Leadership that knows we need more than hope, leadership that knows we need answers.We must make hard decisions that are necessary to avert disaster.If we don't, in less than a decade, every dollar of federal revenue will go to covering the costs of Medicare, Social Security and interest payments on our debt.Meanwhile, we'll sink deeper into debt for everything else - from national security to disaster relief.Our country will fall behind the productivity of other countries. Our influence in the world will wane. Our security will grow ever more precarious. And the 21st Century will then be known as the end of the American Century. We can't accept this, and we won't.But here is the challenge.We must proceed at a time of weak economic growth and very high unemployment.We desperately need jobs and the opportunities they carry. So, we must play to our strengths, and give the most innovative society on Earth the tools they need to succeed.We must make broad and bold changes to our tax code and regulatory policies; seize the lost opportunity of energy independence and reestablish what it means to be a teacher in society.We must reignite the powerful job creating engine of our economy - the industry, innovation, reliability, and trailblazing genius of Americans and their enterprises -- and restore confidence in our people.We can and will own the future.Now, we did many of these things in the great state of Utah when I was governor. We cut taxes. We flattened rates. We balanced our budget. We worked very hard to maintain our AAA bond rating status, something few states can claim. And when the economic crisis hit, we were prepared.And by many accounts we became the best state in America for business. We also were named the best managed state in America.You see, we proved that government doesn't have to choose between fiscal responsibility and economic growth. I learned something very important as Governor. For most American families, there is nothing more important than a job.Internationally, we will lead the world in a way that speaks to preeminence. And let us not forget that we are a nation at war.This came home to me as I spoke to the VFW Convention recently in the state of New Hampshire. There joined by my good friend Paul Chevalier, a former Marine, and there we looked at America's greatest generation.All of whom were there in their outfits and the ribbons that they had earned during a time of conflict. I saw in their eyes stories about which you could make great movies. I saw America's Greatest Generation.They lived through the depression, they lived through World War II and beyond, and they delivered to this country in ways that protected and preserved our liberty and freedom, and I'm here to tell you we have another of America's greatest generations coming up and they are ready to rebuild America just like earlier generations.We're at war, ladies and gentlemen, and we must manage the end of these conflicts without repeating past mistakes that made our engagement longer and our sacrifices greater than they should have been.It's not that we wish to disengage from the world, don't get me wrong, but rather that we believe the best long- term national security strategy is rebuilding our core here at home.Now let me say something about civility. For the sake of the younger generation, it concerns me that civility, humanity and respect are sometimes lost in our interactions as Americans.Our political debates today are corrosive and not reflective of the belief that Abe Lincoln espoused back in his day, that we are a great country because we are a good country.You know what I mean when I say that.We will conduct this campaign on the high road. I don't think you need to run down someone's reputation in order to run for the Office of President.Of course we'll have our disagreements. That's what campaigns are all about.But I want you to know that I respect my fellow Republican candidates.And I respect the President of the United States.He and I have a difference of opinion on how to help a country we both love.But the question each of us wants the voters to answer is who will be the better President; not who's the better American.Now, behind me is our most famous symbol of the promise of America.President Reagan launched the 1980 general election campaign from this very spot. It was a time of trouble, worry and difficulty.He assured us we could "make America great again," and through his leadership, he did.Today, I stand in his shadow as well as the shadow of this magnificent monument to our liberty.For 125 years, through triumphs and hardships of all kinds, her lamp has been a beacon reflecting America's highest aspirations and values. America's promises have been kept.Each generation in their turn has worked very hard to keep her lit.Now it's our turn.Our challenges are many and urgent. But our problems are no bigger than our opportunities.And they're not insurmountable for a people who've always used our freedom to make the future better than the past.We are a resourceful, ingenious, determined, problem solving people.We don't settle for less than our character and talents will achieve. We choose our destiny as a nation. We always have, and we always will.This is that moment. We're not just choosing new leaders.We're choosing whether we are to be yesterday's story or tomorrow's. Everything is at stake.This is the hour when we choose our future.I'm Jon Huntsman, and I'm running for President of the United States.Thank you all. A president's approach to foreign affairs — how he or she views the world, and views America's role on the world stage — is perhaps the most critical function of that sacred office.This has been true throughout our nation's history, whether it was Truman in the dawn of the Atomic Age, Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis, Reagan and the Soviet Union.But it has never been more critical than today. We are a nation mired in multiple military engagements overseas, and in the grips of an economic crisis at home.These are tumultuous times not just for our nation, but all nations.Instability in the Middle East, debt crises across Europe, the looming threat of nuclear proliferation. The world needs American leadership now more than ever. Yet we are struggling to provide it.President Obama's policies have weakened America, and thus diminished America's presence on the global stage.We must correct our course.I've lived overseas four times. I've seen the world as a diplomat, as a businessman, as a humanitarian. I've lived in and seen what our most significant competitor nations are doing to prepare for the rest of the 21st Century. And I have a very clear vision of what America must do as well. I believe the United States has a generational opportunity to redefine its place in the world, and reclaim the mantle of global leadership.My administration's approach to foreign affairs will be guided by that which defines American exceptionalism, and that is our values: liberty, democracy, human rights, free markets.America's values, ladies and gentlemen, are America's best gift to humanity. To those nations who share our values, and who we call friends and allies, we will restore trust and strengthen our bonds — both economically and militarily.To those nations who continue to resist the unstoppable march of human, political and economic freedom, we will make clear that they are on the wrong side of history, by ensuring that America's light shines bright in every corner of the globe, representing a beacon of hope and inspiration. We will establish a foreign policy doctrine that reflects our modern world. Simply advocating more ships, more troops, and more weapons is not a viable path forward. We need more agility, more intelligence, and more economic engagement with the world.How will we do this?In short, erase the old map. End nation-building, engage our allies, and fix our core. This is how we will fight the enemy we have, and renew American exceptionalism. Today I'd like to discuss the five planks which will comprise my administration's foreign policy.1) First and foremost, we must rebuild America's coreAt this critical juncture in history, our nation's greatest challenge does not emanate from outside our borders, but from within.Nearly 15 million of our fellow Americans are unemployed, denied the dignity of a job. Millions more are so dispirited they've given up looking.Our national debt continues to streak toward unsustainable levels.Right here in New Hampshire, in Hillsborough County, Sheriff James Hardy — who has served for 30 years -- told me that for the first time ever, his folks are handing out foreclosure notices to the middle class.All this is after trillions of dollar in government spending and massive bailouts.Our nation's core is weak. Our people are hurting. And America cannot project power abroad when we are weak at home.It's increasingly evident that we've lost leverage in the international community. In just the last few weeks, we saw the Palestinians make an end-run around the American-led peace process, because they lost confidence in it, and in our ability to lead.The world is a better place when America leads. The world is a safer place when America leads. And our interests are best served when America leads.But to lead abroad, we must regain strength at home.Returning people to work, reducing our debt, restoring confidence in our future...fixing America firstthat will be my most urgent priority.It will require more than half-measures. It will require serious, bold reforms to our tax and regulatory systems — reforms that I have offered as part of a plan that one economist calls the most pro-growth proposal ever offered by a presidential candidate.I will drop that plan on the front steps of Congress on day one, and will not stop fighting until we get the job done.2) We need a foreign policy of expansion, not containmentStrengthening our core means dramatic overhauls of our tax and regulatory codes. It also means empowering American entrepreneurs to compete in the global marketplace, and sell their products to customers around the world.America once had a foreign policy based on containmentthe containment of communism. Today, we need a foreign policy based on expansionthe expansion of America's competitiveness and engagement in the world through partnerships and trade agreements. Free trade supports nearly 18 million American jobs, and establishing new lines of trade with international partners represents an enormous well of untapped economic and political goodwill.95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders, yet the United States is party to only 17 of the more than 300 trade agreements worldwide.We will particularly seek greater trade opportunities with nations that share our values; that believe in good government, open markets and rule of law; as well as nations willing to engage in reform efforts toward those ends.It starts with passing the three pending trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, which President Obama has resisted for three years, and which could boost American exports by more than $10 billion and create tens of thousands of American jobs.We should aggressively push for the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will open markets in Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.We should pursue trade agreements with Japan and Taiwan.We need to pursue free trade agreements as aggressively as China. China is in the game. We are not.America must also support the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations, aimed at promoting trade between developed and developing nations.This is an opportunity for the unstoppable tide of economic advancement to lift all ships, and it falls to America to lead this effort.Energy independence is another critical piece of not only our foreign policy, but our economic policy.Every year America sends more than $300 billion overseas for imported oil — much of it to the Middle East.I've offered a comprehensive plan to free ourselves from OPEC's grasp by relying more on domestic supplies of oil and gas — to the benefit of our national and economic security.3) We must right-size our current foreign entanglementsSimply put, we are risking American blood and treasure in parts of the world where our strategy needs to be rethought.Afghanistan was once the center of the terrorist threat to America. That is no longer the case. The Soviets were there for nine years before they left with over 14,000 dead. They tried to crush the Afghans with pure poweraerial bombing and strafing and helicopter gunships and tanks.We have been there ten years and are taking a different approach. We are nation building. Our presence there should not focus on nation building, however, but rather on counterterrorism. We cannot social engineer other countries. We can't even social engineer our own inner cities. It is cultural arrogance to think we can make tribal leaders into democratic leaders. It is wishful thinking to believe that our troops, by staying for a couple more years, will prevent further instability or even civil war.Our men and women in uniform have done their all, given their all, in Afghanistan and Iraq. They routed the Taliban and crippled Al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks. They have taken the fight abroad so we didn't have to face it here at home. Our nation has done its duty. After 6,000 lives lost and more than $1 trillion spent, it is time to bring our brave troops home. And as they return, we will take care of them, and help our veterans transition from the battlefront to the homefront.We could go from 100,000 boots on the ground to a much smaller footprint in a year, while leaving behind an adequate number of counterterrorist and intelligence functions and a facile special forces presence. And I believe we should.As for the argument that our exit will destabilize Pakistan . . . the truth is Only Pakistan can save Pakistan. Only Afghanistan can save Afghanistan. And right now we should focus on America saving America. Our future is not in the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan. It is in schools and universities just like this one — which educate our leaders and entrepreneurs of tomorrow. It is in Silicon Valley. It is in the industrial corridors of the Midwest. It is in our farms and factories, and our ports that ship our products to the world. Let me be clear. Pakistan — which possesses a demonstrated nuclear weapons capability and a fractured military that sponsors terrorism — does demand U.S. attention. Yet we must acknowledge certain realities as we consider the wisest way forward. This is not a relationship based on shared values. It is transactional at best.Many Americans are rightly suspicious of Islamabad in the wake of the Bin Laden operation. Likewise, despite billions of dollars in aid, the United States is held in very low regard throughout the country. We cannot dictate fundamental changes upon an age-old civilization from afar.But make no mistake. As president, I will protect American security interests in Pakistan without being naive about Islamabad's incentives and long-term interests.There is another advantage to a more judicious approach toward foreign entanglements. It helps prevent our military from being stretched too thin, and unable to effectively respond to a direct security threat — either to America, or one of our allies.This includes standing shoulder to shoulder with Israel as they manage a host of new challenges brought on by the Arab Spring, along with more familiar challenges, such as a hostile Iran, which will continue to be a transcendent challenge of the next decade. I cannot live with a nuclear-armed Iran. If you want an example of when I would consider the use of American force, it would be that.A reexamination of America's role in the world also requires a reexamination of our military and defense infrastructure. It may surprise some people to learn that we spend more on defense today than at the height of the Cold War. Indeed, we spend more on defense than the rest of the world combined. We still have remnants of a top-heavy, post-Cold War infrastructure. It needs to be transformed to reflect the 21st Century world, and the growing asymmetric threats we face.For example, counterterrorism needs to be a much larger part of our foreign policy.We must be prepared to respond to threats — from Al Qaeda and other terrorist cells — that emanate from a much more diverse geography, including Yemen, the Horn of Africa, Pakistan and the Asia-Pacific. We must also adapt our defenses to evolving means of attack. This means a greater focus on intelligence gathering and more agile special forces units, which can respond swiftly and firmly to terrorist threats in any corner of the globe.The traditional roles and missions of our armed forces will remain relevant for the foreseeable future — but the relative importance of counter-terrorism, intelligence gathering training and equipping foreign security forces, and special forces operations will continue to grow going forward.We must also transform our orientation.I have come to believe that we are embarking on a Pacific Centuryin which America must and will play a dominant role.By almost any objective measure — population, economic power, military might, energy use — the center of gravity of global human activity is moving toward the Asia-Pacific region.Embracing this reality may bring a dramatic change to the look of our military. The Asia Pacific is a maritime theater whereas Europe was mostly a land theater.For the U.S., the Asia-Pacific features a collection of bilateral military alliances in contrast to the presence of NATO in Europe. And the Asia-Pacific is full of disputed islands and resource claims when compared to the relative calm of other regions.We are a Pacific nation, and our vital interests in that region cannot be compromised.4) We must strengthen our relationships with major powers Our traditional alliance relationships with Europe remain vital to American security, and we should also work closely with our friends in NATO and the European Union to bring Russia, a sometimes difficult actor, closer to the West.But I believe that the reemergence of two ancient lands — China and India — will most influence how America navigates the 21st Century. First, China.There is no other relationship that, if mismanaged, carries greater negative consequences for America and the world. Alternatively, wise stewardship of the U.S.-China relationship will make America and our allies safer and more prosperous.The stakes are enormous, as are the challenges and opportunities.Naturally, we will disagree oftenwhether over Taiwan's security needs, human rights, or the protection of intellectual property rights.While avoiding a trade war, we must also press China to open its markets to our exports and increase internal demand, so China's growth is not at the expense of our workers.Yet a fundamental question is: will we also find areas of cooperation? Our relationship with China has been a transactional one for 40 years. We buy their products. They buy our bonds. But for a truly healthy relationship, we need to infuse the relationship with shared values.Until that time, we should begin to build a broader and more cooperative agenda. The United States and China can and should today start collaborating on clean energy technologies, combating global pandemics, and countering piracy on the high seas.We must also strengthen our relationship with India — a country that shares our values: religious tolerance, respect for human rights, and a commitment to democracy.We must begin with negotiations to reach an eventual trade agreement, creating hundreds of millions of additional consumers for American products.But our relationship with India needs to go beyond economics.The arc of countries that lie along the Indian Ocean border some of the most important energy and trading lanes in the world. Those lanes are critical for the free flow of commerce, and remain vulnerable to threats small and large. To that end, I welcome the Indian Navy's transformation into a blue water navy.As president, I will increase our military and diplomatic cooperation with India, with the expectation that they share responsibility in maintaining peace and security in this vital region.And recognizing India's emerging role, I will also support our ally's bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, as is fitting a country representing one-sixth of humanity.5) Finally, we must take care of our own neighborhoodFor too long the United States has neglected its commitment to the countries in our backyardthe Western Hemisphere. The result is lost opportunities, strained relations and escalating security challenges.Latin America is not only a neighbor with whom we share a rich history; it is also a major source of untapped economic opportunities.The U.S. exports three times as much to Latin America as we do to China. But many nations in our hemisphere are experiencing a terrifying surge in violence that threatens to disrupt this progress.The wave of bloodshed that has swept over Mexico — the result of corruption and collusion with drug cartels — has left 35,000 people dead, creating casualties even inside America's borders.Mexico stands ready to work with the U.S. in combating the drug war, and we should commit to continued cooperation, including enhanced military-to-military engagement.In Guatemala, escalating violence is resulting in an average of 55 murders per week, threatening an already overloaded justice system. These problems, though, are not contained within Guatemala's borders.The country has emerged as a funnel for regional narco-criminal activity, threatening our neighbors and ourselves. As President, I will not accept the status quo. I will support our neighbors to quickly and sternly eliminate these narco-terrorists.Colombia offers a fine example of the benefits of American engagement and investment in our hemisphere.After years of drug violence, Colombia — initially under the courageous leadership of President Uribe — pushed back the FARC and weakened the drug cartels, while professionalizing its military and police forces.Colombia now aspires to be a regional leader in Latin America, and they are well on their way.There is also tremendous potential within Brazil, the world's 5th largest country and 7th largest economy.Brazil is rich with opportunity in the energy and technology industries, which we should recognize with the initiation of bilateral trade negotiations.By forging partnerships and alliances, we can help develop political and economic stability throughout the region, thus creating an environment in which all the peoples of Latin America can rise.We must not forget that peace and prosperity throughout our neighborhood, promotes peace and prosperity at home.I'd like to close by sharing a thought from my time in China.Emotionally, one of the most powerful things I did as ambassadoror could do was meet with dissidents. I would do this frequently. Sometimes I would go to them. Sometimes they would come to the Embassy. We did this quietly. It was a real peril for them, and it also closed some official doors to me.But what was always clear to me was that those seeking reform and change drew strength from our nation's valuesthe openness, the freedoms of speech, assembly, religion and press. Half a world away they could see this country's light. Dissidents around the world can see it.All the troops in the world cannot give you that light. You either have it or you don't.That is America's value in the world today.When we shine our light abroad magnified by a strong core at home, we are invincible.Ronald Reagan said that America was "an empire of ideals."Ladies and gentlemen, if we maintain our empire of ideals, not only will we further the cause of liberty, human rights, free markets and free enterprise abroad, we will strengthen it right here at home.And that is a cause around which all of our citizens can and must be united.Thank you for inviting me, and for your warm hospitality. It's an honor to be back at the University of New Hampshire; a university that has distinguished itself as a leader in academics, research and innovation.A few minutes ago I visited your cogeneration plant, which has earned national accolades.Using processed landfill gas, it serves as this campus's primary energy source—powering your gymnasium, your dorm rooms and to the dislike of some, your lecture halls.By taking more control of its energy supply, the university benefits from a stable energy source and predictable energy prices.The need to make our nation itself energy secure is what I'd like to address today.We are all too familiar with the statistics.Fifty years ago, President Eisenhower warned we should import no more than 20 percent of our oil. Today we import 60 percent.Energy security can no longer be a catchphrase; it will be a driving force behind my administration's agenda.Because this is an issue critical to solving two of America's most urgent challenges: putting people back to work, and ending our heroin-like addiction to foreign oil.Every year we send $300 billion—half our trade deficit—overseas for oil, to unstable and unfriendly regimes.300 billion dollars to our competitors and nations with whom we have nothing more than a transactional relationship. I want that money going to American energy suppliers, spent in American stores, saved in American banks, and invested in American communities to create American jobs.That's just one economic aspect of our dependence on foreign imports.10 of our last 11 recessions were preceded by sharp spikes in the price of oil. Three years ago, it was the doubling of oil prices that helped bring our economy to its knees.When prices rise, and motorists and truckers have no choice but to pay more at the pump, it depresses economic growth.Energy drives everything we do.How can we stabilize our economy when its most fundamental building block is controlled in large part by despots and dictators half a world away?Even if a political crisis doesn't threaten oil supplies, increased demand from China, India and other developing countries will lead to permanently heightened prices that exceed the highs of 2008.Today oil remains in the high 80's despite a global recession. Imagine where prices will be when the global economy recovers.Ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of America's economic and national security, we must unshackle ourselves from the scourge of foreign oil.So how do we do that?There are three basic steps that need to be taken.First, America is drowning in energy resources. So we must remove the regulatory constraints on the production of domestic energy.Second, we need to break oil's monopoly as a transportation fuel, and create a truly level playing field for competing fuels.Third, we need to build an environment that will incubate the next generation of energy technologies and ensure that America leads the global energy economy in the decades to come.So number one, we must increase domestic production.Oil is a plentiful resource across America. From the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska, our country has abundant untapped resources.Yes, there is a balancing act between utilizing our resources and maintaining the integrity of our oceans and forests. But there is no reason drilling cannot be safely conducted in the Gulf, across the states and in Alaska.It's important to note that from beginning to end—that is, from initial geologic survey to the time oil reaches the gas pump—it can take ten years.Regulations and approvals for new wells and pipelines need to be streamlined and directed to "move at the speed of business."President Reagan created a mechanism for the swift resolution of regulatory delays without sacrificing safety. With one in ten Americans out of work, the same approach must be duplicated again.On top of the resources available here in our own country, our friend and ally Canada has enormous energy reserves. In fact, America imports twice as much oil from Canada as Saudi Arabia, and our neighbor is increasing production every day.There are 170 billion barrels of oil in Alberta's oil sands—more reserves than in all of Iraq. Yet lawsuits and legislation threaten to block access to this resource.My administration will stand behind the Keystone pipeline, creating more than 100,000 American jobs while reducing our dependence on overseas imports.Every barrel from a friend is one less from a foe.Hyperbolic fracturing is also an opportunity to expand our domestic energy production.Because of fracking and its companion, parallel drilling, the United States has surpassed Russia as the world's leading producer of natural gas.As we speak, fracking is leading a manufacturing revival across the Midwest in cities like Youngstown, Ohio, where hundreds of jobs are being created.Unlocking vast new oil deposits, like in North Dakota's Bakken Field, also will come through fracking.Hyperbolic fracking has been used on more than one million wells using a technology refined over 60 years, and the industry must continue to demonstrate to the American people it is a safe and sustainable practice.As president, I will break down barriers to the continued, safe use of fracking, which could increase America's production of natural gas by 25 percent—an outcome the American people deserve.Coal, while viewed with hostility by some, is one of America's most abundant energy resources and the mainstay of many communities.It generates the majority of America's power, and the expansion of an emerging technology, coal-to-liquid fuel, will allow us to take full advantage of our coal reserves, which could supply us for 300 years.Today coal is under siege from government regulations and litigation. There are even efforts to halt the export of our coal, which would destroy American jobs.This summer, in fact, we will likely see blackouts as a result of the administration's assault on coal, which will take 8% of U.S. generating capacity offline.In a time of economic uncertainty, subjecting American businesses to even more volatile energy prices indicates a grave lack of judgment, and a wrong that my administration will make right.However, we cannot simply drill our way to energy security; we also need to use the power of the marketplace.This means breaking oil's monopoly as a transportation fuel, and creating a truly level playing field for competing fuels.So number two, we must break oil's monopoly.America's prosperity has always flowed from competition, and I believe it's time to let creative destruction loose in our energy sector. Energy security, as Winston Churchill said, "lies in variety and variety alone."Yet the current system of transportation fuels is essentially closed to competition because of gasoline's de facto monopoly for light-duty vehicles and diesel's near-monopoly for heavy-duty vehicles.The concentration of distribution ownership is similar to the broadcast network domination in the early 1970s, which triggered market-opening FCC rules and an antitrust consent decree.Accordingly, the Federal Trade Commission and Senate Judiciary Committee must commence an expedited review of the fuel distribution network.Breaking oil's monopoly will also require the repeal of regulations that prevent a truly open and fair market.America has more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil. Yet on August 9th, the Obama Administration issued fuel efficiency rules that effectively bar heavy-duty vehicles—which consume 20% of our oil imports—from converting to natural gas.Amazingly, they did this even after conceding that more alternative-fueled vehicles would increase national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil.The EPA has also imposed costly rules with respect to converting cars to natural gas, which is cheap, clean and available for refueling in nearly half of American homes.It has effectively barred states, which have the primary responsibility for meeting air quality standards, from switching fleets to electric cars and clean fuels.Rolling back these and other similar rules will be an immediate priority of my administration.And finally, number three, we must build a new energy future.As we take steps to meet current energy demands, we must also build an environment that will promote innovation and help foster the next generation of energy technologies.We must reduce barriers and increase investment in a modern "smart grid."Such a system will lead to improved efficiency and resilience, and will be sorely needed if the next generation, for example, chooses to charge electric vehicles in their garages.Development of a "smart grid" should be done in tandem with support for innovative state-based solutions.California leads the nation in geothermal. The Northwest has world-class hydropower facilities. 15 percent of Iowa's energy comes from wind.When I was governor of Utah, we made great strides in natural gas. We designated a natural gas corridor through our state, and partnered with the private sector to build a network of fueling stations. I even drove a natural gas car.States are laboratories of innovation, yet federal rules handcuff them with red tape.Washington needs to give states more flexibility to develop unique energy solutions.To assure our long-term competitiveness, America must also prioritize investment in basic research that will lead to the energy technologies of tomorrow.The IEA predicts that by 2035, the global energy economy will be a $38 trillion economy.Which nation will lead that energy economy?Which nation's innovators will develop the technologies that transform our energy future, and then sell those technologies to the world?That nation must be America.My administration will remove regulatory barriers that are slowing development of the next generation of nuclear technology, including small modular reactors—thus making America competitive in a sector we once pioneered.We will also reaffirm our support for non-commercial research at ARPA-E—the DOE's version of DARPA—and invest more funding in pure research at our universities, like this one.However, we must not confuse pure research with politically-driven industrial policy such as we saw with Solyndra.We must have a level playing field, with the federal government setting fair rules, but investing only in basic research.Breaking oil's monopoly and freeing ourselves from OPEC's grasp will not be easy.For decades presidents have talked about energy independence, with lots of rhetoric but little results.America cannot afford the status quo any longer, nor can we afford half-measures, nor can we allow reform to be derailed and delayed once again by powerful, entrenched interests.On my first day in office, I will take three immediate steps to launch a sea change in energy policy.I will direct my administration to clarify rules that ensure the safe and rapid expansion of offshore drilling and fracking.I will move to open our fuel distribution network to all forms of energy, biofuels, natural gas and electricity.I will systemically begin to eliminate every subsidy for energy companies, whether it be oil, natural gas, wind or solar. Under my presidency, the United States will get out of the subsidy business. And if necessary, I will use my executive authority to act unilaterally.We will stop using limited federal resources to prop up individual companies—directing that money instead to basic energy research.Whether it is our tax code, our foreign policy, or our energy policy, we need bold reforms that are equal to the monumental challenges we face.I'm running to transform America's economic foundation, and give the American people the tools to compete in the 21st Century.If we succeed, we can leave to our children and grandchildren a safer, healthier, more secure, more prosperous future.That is our obligation to the next generation—to your generation—and it's an obligation we must and will fulfill.Thank you. The institutions that fill our nation's capital were founded with virtuous intentions, to protect our most fundamental ideals: democracy, rule of law, open markets.Today though, more than ever, these once venerable institutions are viewed by many Americans with disdain and distrust…increasingly tarnished by scandal, corruption, and waste.Our nation is hurting. 15 million unemployed. $15 trillion in debt. The misery index at a 20-year high. The highest poverty rate since the War on Poverty was launched.Yet our challenges go beyond raw statistics.America suffers from a deficit of dollars and jobs. We also suffer from a deficit of trust -- trust in our institutions of power, from Washington to Wall Street.The American people have lost trust, first and foremost, in the president.A president who, rather than focusing like a laser on fixing our economic core, wasted an entire year jamming through a health care plan the American people didn't ask for and can't afford.A president who brazenly ignored the bold and creative proposals put forth by his own bipartisan deficit commission - Simpson-Bowles - whose failure to deal honestly with our debt caused the first-ever downgrade in our nation's credit rating.A president who has employed the same crony politics he once decried; who has used public dollars to pay off campaign contributors like Solyndra; and who has been willing, through his National Labor Relations Board, to sacrifice American jobs to appease union allies.The people have lost trust in Congress, and their ability to come together for the common good - dysfunction evidenced by the supercommittee's recent failure.They've lost trust in our tax code, riddled with carve-outs and pay-outs for special interests.They've lost trust in our wars, wondering why we are risking blood and treasure nation-building abroad, instead of rebuilding our own nation.They've lost trust in Wall Street and their regulators, whose failings led to a taxpayer bailout that defies the core principles of our capitalist economy: free markets, competition, accountability, and failure.Above all, people have lost trust that their elected leaders in this city are working for them.Rather than a limited, efficient government that serves the public's interest, Washington has grown bloated and bureaucratic, captured and corrupted by swarms of lobbyists, influence-peddlers and crony capitalists.People see the revolving door between Capitol Hill and K Street, where the overseers and the overseen morph into each other; where the best-connected perpetuate their government preferences, whether they be bank bailouts or outdated weapons systems; where former congressmen earn millions of dollars lobbying and consulting for entities they once regulated.The American people have been let down, time and again. They have lost confidence in how our nation is run. As a result, anxiety and worry have filled our nation's psyche.We are a country divided, and suffering from self-doubt.Yet we cannot let this temporary anguish diminish who we are as a nation.America exceptionalism is built on our ability to rebound from adversity, and overcome any challenge thrown our way.Correcting our course, and restoring trust with the American people, will take more than rhetoric and slogans. It will take a bold vision, and reforms equal to the historic challenges we face.That is what I am offering the American people.  I will begin with reform of our 17,000 page tax code. I will eliminate every last loophole, subsidy and carve-out. I will use that revenue to lower rates across the board, for individuals and businesses. I will create a tax code that is flatter and simpler; one that opens up economic opportunities for all our citizens, makes us more competitive, and ends corporate welfare and crony capitalism, once and for all.    I will deal honestly with our mounting debt by cutting spending in every corner of government, leaving no sacred cow untouched. I will reform entitlement programs - based on the Ryan Plan - while holding true to our nation's commitments to those in or near retirement.    I will ensure that no financial entity is too-big-to-fail. I will do this by breaking up the big banks on Wall Street, so that never again - never again - are taxpayers held hostage by a Sophie's Choice: massive bailouts, or economic calamity.    I will fulfill a promise presidents have made for six decades, and adopt a comprehensive energy strategy that frees us from foreign oil, that eliminates all energy subsidies, and that levels the playing field for competing fuels and technologies.    All too often our regulatory framework becomes another tool for special interests seeking to use the state to protect privileges and insulate themselves from competition.  I will systematically streamline regulations in order to create a free, fair and competitive marketplace.    I will bring our troops home from Afghanistan, while leaving behind an appropriately-sized counterterrorist presence. And I will set our military strategy and budgets based on long-term threats and vulnerabilities, not on spending patterns developed decades ago and reinforced today by armies of lobbyists.    Finally, in order to ensure that government responds to all its citizens with the same level of urgency and fairness, and to lessen the influence of special interests, I will send to Congress a "Citizen Legislature Act."I will propose a constitutional amendment imposing term limits on members of Congress: six two-year terms in the House, two six-year terms in the Senate.I will ban members of Congress and Cabinet officers from lobbying for four years following their departure.I will seek a lifetime ban on Congress members and Cabinet officers lobbying on any issue where they had significant responsibility.And I will also require them to publicly release all income for four years following their service.We must save capitalism from crony capitalists, and return to our Founder's vision of a limited government that protects free markets and provides a level playing field of opportunity.Turning this vision into reality will require a consistent, principled leader who can unite the American people around these common goals.Someone who has earned trust by delivering upon their promises.I campaigned for governor on a 10-point plan to fix the economy. And I delivered.I signed historic tax reform, including a flat tax. I balanced budgets, cut waste, and tripled our state's savings account. As a result, our economy grew at triple the national rate and led the nation in job growth.Hope and change are easily promised. But trust must be earned and built over time.The president came to office with a mandate to restore trust in Washington, yet his inexperience and failure to lead have left us worse off. He promised to change Washington, and then immediately succumbed to the partisanship, corporate handouts, bailouts, and spending that have made it so reviled.My opponents offer no better. Governor Romney will say anything to earn the voters trust. We are in this mess because there are already enough people in Washington who make a career out of telling people what they want to hear. Newt Gingrich is a product of that same Washington, who participated in the excesses of our broken and polarized political system. You may not agree with me on every single issue.But you'll always know exactly where I stand, and I will never waver from my conservative convictions.When I say something, I mean it. And when I promise to do something, I'll do it.In an era of downsizing, we won't downsize our dreams, and aspirations.We won't run from our problems.  We will meet them head on.But to do that America needs leadership its people can have full faith in.A leader who, by example, can restore accountability and make our institutions worthy of our people. A leader who knows America's place in the world, and all that we inspire.Despite our problems, despite the tough choices ahead - we are resilient, we are determined, we are full of promise.I see a nation that can and must once again be "indivisible with liberty and justice for all."I ask for the people's trust.  Together we will build that America. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're in the hunt. [cheers and applause]CROWD: On the hunt, on the hunt, on the hunt. On the hunt, on the hunt.HUNTSMAN: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.I'd say third place is a ticket to ride, ladies and gentlemen. [cheers and applause]Ladies and gentlemen, we are here tonight because of you. We've got the greatest volunteers, the greatest organizers this state has ever seen. Give yourselves a hand!And we proved the point that this state wants its candidates to earn it the old-fashioned way. That's on the ground, hand shake by hand shake, conversation by conversation, vote by vote. We got it done, ladies and gentlemen!You know what else we got done during this great seven months where we've had at least 170 public events in this great state -- 170 public events. No one even came close. We had conversations about the importance of putting this country first, ladies and gentlemen. Because the people --CROWD: Country first, Country first, Country first, Country first, Country first.HUNTSMAN: -- because the people of this great nation, the greatest nation that ever was, they're tired of being divided. They want leadership that will stand up and tell us all that, first and foremost, we need to come together as Americans in order to solve our problems.We need a president, ladies and gentlemen, who is going to stand up and say we have an economic deficit. It's called 15 trillion dollars in debt. This isn't a debt problem. It is a national security problem. And we are not going to leave it to the next generation of Americans, ladies and gentlemen.And I want to stand up and I want to square with the American people about this. Afghanistan is not our nation's future. And Iraq is not this nation's future. Our nation's future is how prepared we are to rise up as the American people and hit head-on the competitive challenges of the 21st century. You know what I'm talking about?And this is about economics. This is about education. This is going to play out over the Pacific Ocean, with countries that I have lived in before. All I can tell you tonight, without any hint of hyperbole, folks, if we don't get our act together at home, we will see the end of the American century by 2050. And we are not going to let that happen, are we?CROWD: No.HUNTSMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, we have also been able to get our message out to the people of this great state about a second deficit that we have. It's not an economic deficit, but it is just as corrosive as the economic deficit. It's called a trust deficit.Because the people of the greatest nation that ever was, the United States of America, no longer trust their institutions of power and no longer trust their elected officials. And I say, how did we get to this spot? We are too good as people to be in this hole.We are the most blue sky, problem solving, can do, optimistic people on Earth. And we're going to get out there and we're going to address the trust deficit. It's going to start -- it's going to start with Congress, because everybody knows Congress needs term limits!Everybody knows we have to close that revolving door that allows members of Congress to file right on out to become lobbyists, trading in on their insider information and relationships. And we wonder why there is cynicism, as seen by the American people toward Congress. No trust!I say, there is no trust in our wars abroad, ladies and gentlemen. And we're going to fix that part. Because I'm going to stand up in front of the American people and I'm going to say, we have something to show for our 10 years in the war on terror. Something to show for the American people that's mighty important.We have run the Taliban from power. We have up-ended and dismantled al Qaeda. They're now in sanctuaries in Waziristan and beyond. Osama bin Laden is no longer along. We have had free elections. We have strengthened civil society and helped the military and helped the police.We have done what this nation can do. It is time to bring the troops home from Afghanistan, ladies and gentlemen. We need trust infused back into this nation. We need a president who's going to be able to stand up and say it's time we come together as Americans, first and foremost.This nation, the greatest nation on Earth, has every attribute a nation would ever want for success. You know that? That's why we're going to succeed as we go forward. All we need is a little bit of leadership and a plan. I saw this nation from 10,000 miles away. You hear me? Ten thousand miles away. When you see this nation from abroad, you tend to see it in bold colors. You know what I saw from 10,000 miles away, living over in China?I saw a nation with the greatest people on Earth, a nation that is down for the moment, down temporarily, but a nation that's about to rise up again, because we have every attribute a nation would ever want to succeed.We have stability. We have rule of law. We have the longest surviving Constitution in the world. We even have private property rights right here in New Hampshire. We have the greatest colleges and universities on Earth.And people flock here from every corner to attend them. We have the most creative innovative and entrepreneurial people anywhere. And they're sitting on their hands because there is no confidence about the direction or the leadership of this nation.And I say, that's an engine of growth that we are going to re- fire. I say, we have the greatest and most courageous armed forces this nation has ever seen. [applause]I'll be darned if we're going to allow the men and women to come from the theaters of combat, the front lines, to the unemployment lines. That's not going to happen.Those men and women who have worn the uniform of the United States of America in the theater of combat are going to come home to dignity and respect and to admiration. And they're going to come home to jobs and opportunity as well.And they're going to do the same thing for this nation that the Greatest Generation did so many decades ago. They rebuilt this nation. They pulled this nation up by the bootstraps. And there's another greatest generation coming up.You know the people I'm talking about? They're in your families. They're in our neighborhoods. We love them all. They are going to do what earlier generations did. They are going to help us rebuild this nation. They are going to help us make it the very best it possibly can be.Ladies and gentlemen, I love this state. This state -- this state -- this state, we have worked hard and diligently. We have pounded the pavement. We have shaken hands. We have had conversations. We have won people over, person by person.This is the old way to get politics done in New Hampshire. My confidence in the system is reborn because of the people in New Hampshire, because they just turn out at these town hall meetings. Nobody forces them. Nobody tells them they have to do it. It's because they believe in a better tomorrow for the United States of America.CROWD: [inaudible]HUNTSMAN: Thank you. Thank you very much. They turn out to the town hall meetings and they turn out to the house parties. And they hear from the candidates. And then they assimilate and they digest it all. And then they render a judgment.And here we sit tonight, ladies and gentlemen, with a ticket to ride and to move on. Here we go to South Carolina.Thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you all so very much. Thank you! Good morning, everybody. I am delighted to be surrounded first and foremost by those I love and I appreciate most.I'm up here with the greatest human being I've ever known, my wife Mary Kaye, who has sustained us throughout this journey.I'm also up here with an interesting group of campaign activists called the "Jon 2012 girls," and I'm delighted to be with them — Mary Anne and Abby and Liddy. I'm also delighted to be joined by our daughter Gracie, who also dubbed as our campaign's senior foreign policy adviser, and I want to compliment her on the excellent job that she did.I'm here with my father and I want to express my love and appreciation to him, son-in-law Jeff Livingston as well, along with a terrific team.Some supporters like the beloved Iris Campbell, former First Lady of this great state, is with us as is the Attorney General Alan Wilson and close personal friend of mine, Mike Campbell, who is here among others. And we're honored and delighted to be in your presence — some of our great supporters.I'd like just to make a few comments about the current state of the presidential race and then we'll let you go.Now as candidates for our party's nomination, our common goal is to restore bold and principled leadership to the White House. Leadership that will re-ignite our economy and renew the American spirit.Yet rather than seeking to advance that common goal by speaking directly to voters about our ideas to rebuild America, this race has degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks not worthy of the American people and not worthy of this critical time in our nation's history.This is the most important election of our lifetime.This country desperately needs to begin a journey that will allow us to courageously tackle our two most urgent deficits. One is an economic deficit. The other is a trust deficit.Only bold ideas will get us to where we need to be. And this campaign needs to be driven by those ideas.At its core, the Republican Party is a party of ideas. But the current toxic form of our political discourse does not help our cause. And it's just one of the many reasons why the American people have lost trust in their elected leaders.Today, I call on each campaign to cease attacking each other and instead talk directly to the American people about how our conservative ideas will create jobs, reduce our nation's debt, stabilize energy prices, and provide a brighter future for our children and our grandchildren.Let's invest our time and resources in building trust with the American people and uniting them around a common purpose.Three years ago, the president promised to unite the American people. Yet his desire to engage in class warfare for political gain has left us more divided than ever. This divisiveness is corrosive and does not advance America's interests.This nation was built on unity and trust. Trust in each other. Trust in a revolution that gave birth to the freest and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. Trust in our system of government.That sense of unity and trust has sustained us through world wars and national tragedies. Now, we need it to sustain us during this hour of need.Ultimately, this election is about more than the future of one campaign or one party. It is about the future of our nation.And for our nation to move forward together with new leadership and unity, the Republican Party must first unite.We entered this race just six months ago with the longest of long shots. My candidacy was staked with the simple principle of country first and driven by a refusal to pass down to the next generation a country that is less powerful, less prosperous, and less competitive than the one we inherited.Today, I am suspending my campaign for the presidency. I believe it is now time for our party to unite around the candidate best equipped to defeat Barack Obama. Despite our differences and the space between us on some of the issues, I believe that candidate is Gov. Mitt Romney.As for the Huntsman family, we step down with an even greater appreciation for American democracy, which is fundamental to American values.After all the town halls and handshakes and meet and greets, we leave it in the hands of the people and we respect the results.To our many staff, supporters, and volunteers, I offer my heartfelt thanks.Today our campaign for the presidency ends but our campaign to build a better and more trustworthy America continues.We will continue to fight for a flatter, simpler tax code that helps unleash opportunity rather than stifle it.For an energy policy that ends the scorch of our addiction to foreign oil.For congressional term limits.For education reform that prepares our kids for the realities of the 21st century.For financial reform that breaks up "too big to fail" banks and protects taxpayers from future bailouts.And we will continue fighting to bring home our brave men and women from Afghanistan and stop nation-building overseas and start rebuilding our own nation.For Mary Kaye and our family, these last six months have been an incredible and awe-inspiring journey.I have seen the very best in America.I've seen it in the spirit of our entrepreneurs, whose innovations continue to inspire and better the world.I've seen it in the courage of our veterans, who I've met in VFW halls in communities all across this nation.I saw in China — 10,000 miles away — meeting with dissidents who have been tortured and beaten but who had drew strength from our nation's values, our openness, our freedoms, our commitment to human rights.Half way around the world, I could still see America's light. That is the power America still projects.And I will never stop fighting for her and fighting to ensure that America's light to shines bright for generations and generations to come.Because in the end we must all come together as Americans and must be reminded that the fight to preserve and enhance life, liberty, and happiness is what really sets us apart in this world and is worth our tireless efforts as citizens in this most of this most extraordinary nation.Thank you and may God bless America.
