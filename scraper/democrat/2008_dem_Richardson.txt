Thank you Kathy. You are a great State Chair. I'd like to thank the State Committee for hosting me. I hope you all take great pride in your work in this last election. The Democratic tidal wave that rushed across America last month started right here in New Hampshire. The people in this room made NH history -- and helped change American history. As chair of the Democratic Governors Association, I was glad to play a small part in that history. Thanks to the hard work of people like you, Democrats have become the majority party. As you may have heard, I met with North Korean diplomats yesterday on their way to the six-party talks, and I'd be happy to take your questions. But this morning, I would like to talk to you about another issue. A quagmire which we Democrats did not create, but which we now must help resolve. Like all of you, I am sure, I have struggled for a long time over Iraq. Like most Americans, I am saddened by the horrific violence that takes dozens, scores of innocent lives every day. And like most Americans, I believe that our country has a moral obligation to do what we can to help the Iraqis end that violence. And because of that belief, it has not been easy for me to come to this conclusion: that the best thing we can do – for them as well as for ourselves – is to leave. Carefully and strategically. But we must leave. And soon. Because our military has done all it can do there. Our troops have done a magnificent job in Iraq under terrible circumstances. But our continued military presence is not helping the Iraqis create a stable order. Our presence is not preventing a bloodbath. That bloodbath is already happening. More than three thousand civilian men, women and children are dying each month. Eighty percent of Iraqis have said they want us to leave. Sixty percent say they think it's justifiable to kill Americans. Sunnis and Shiites alike see us as occupiers, and believe our presence there is making things worse. There is no military solution to Iraq's political crisis. We need to end this fiasco now, and start down the hard path back to a safer future and a more realistic foreign policy. Our safety, as much as the safety of the Iraqis, is at stake. We need to stop throwing good money after bad. We need to stop sending our soldiers to die for a tragic mistake. The message of the mid-term election elections was clear – the American people have lost faith in President Bush and his Iraq policy. Logically, we have only three choices: escalate the war, hunker down and stay, or stand down. The leading advocate for  escalating the war is Senator John McCain. I have served with John in Congress and I respect him. But John McCain is wrong, dead wrong to think that we can solve Iraq's political crisis through military escalation. The fact is, every time we have sent in more troops, violence only increased. There is no military solution to Iraq's political crisis. The second option is to hunker down and stay indefinitely but this will never stabilize Iraq. We can stay and arm and train their police and army. But deadly militias have thoroughly infiltrated both the police and the army at all levels. Much of the sectarian violence is actually being committed by the very people we are training and arming. Only a political solution can stop that. And only the Iraqis can do it. Our only real option is to redeploy our troops, and allow the Iraqis to take responsibility for their country. Look, I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan. I worked in this region. And I've negotiated with folks who are anything but diplomatic-- Sudanese rebels, North Korean Generals, Fidel Castro, the Taliban, and Saddam Hussein. Negotiating with them has helped me develop a pragmatic approach to foreign policy. I call it the New Realismï¿½it values reality over ideology, responsibility over rhetoric, and dialogue over name-calling. I believe it is more important to BE tough, than to talk tough. Iraq is in a state of civil war, and only they can stop it. We are at the point where we now have to choose between bad options and worse ones. We need to choose the path that will do the least damage to American national security. I agree with Senator Levin that our leverage is the withdrawal of our troops. Once Iraq's leaders understand that our military presence in Iraq is neither permanent nor unconditional They are far more likely to take the political steps necessary to deal with their political crisis." We should give the Iraqi cabinet the opportunity to discuss the details of our departure with us and to make suggestions, but we need to establish a 2007 departure date. If the Iraqi government agrees, we should announce jointly that our mission is over, and that we will leave by the specified date. If they don't agree, we should announce that date without them. We should harbor no illusions. This withdrawal will not be pretty. People will die. But fewer will die than if we stay. There are no guarantees that our departure will end the civil war. But it is sure to continue so long as we stay. The Iraqis might, or might not, resolve their political crisis. It is up to them. They distrust and fear one another, and this makes it very tough. But they share one goal – they don't want to destroy their own country. To save it, they need to stop killing each other and start compromising And we need to get out of the way. And then we have a moral obligation to help. Once we are on our way out, I believe we can be helpful in the following ways: First, we should encourage national reconciliation talks. Second, we should work with the Iraqis and the UN to convene a regional conference similar to the Dayton conference that produced a settlement in Yugoslavia. Third, the United States must lead the way on economic assistance for reconstruction. Working with the UN, the Europeans and other countries And for our own security, we must return National Guard troops to their States, where they are needed, and redeploy troops to Afghanistan, to knock down the resurgent Taliban. Redeployment from Iraq will help us rebuild our military, so we can negotiate from a position of strength with countries like Iran, Syria and North Korea. Diplomacy and military power are not alternatives to one another, but rather are complementary sources of strength. Because diplomacy without power is weak, and power without diplomacy is blind. There are no quick or easy answers to the crisis in Iraq. Our choices are between bad options and worse ones. Some prefer military escalation. Some choose staying the course. These options are illusions. The only realistic choice we have is to stand down militarily, and let the Iraqis stand up and face the political crisis which only they can resolve. Thank you. When we were first invited to speak here today, we were told that each of us would only have seven minutes. seven minutes to tell you how we'd better create jobs, expand health care, save the environment, improve our schools, balance the budget, fight terrorism, get out of Iraq, and bring peace to the Middle East.I don't need seven minutes. I can do it in four words. Elect a Democratic president.Now, you're in your second day of hearing political speeches and you've heard from some of our best. You know our country would be a lot better off with any of them serving in the White House -- as my vice president.But the truth, is we will only win the White House if we, as fellow Democrats, who share fundamental core beliefs, don't tear each other down.And we're a party built on a platform of ideas and ideals. We share a fundamental belief in the notion that equality is not achieved by knocking someone else out of the way and kicking them when they're down.Instead, we believe in offering them a hand and lifting them up. It is why, today -- it is why today I am calling on other Democratic candidates to agree to run only positive campaigns in this Democratic nominating process.And, further, I call on the Democratic National Committee to pass a resolution demanding that all the candidates run clean campaigns and not attack each other.You know, I don't buy this nonsense -- that negative campaigns toughen up a nominee. Save it for the Republicans.Now, I could tell you, also, in a positive way, that we need a Democratic nominee who's brokered international agreements, understands the Middle East, has fought global warming, a nominee who has served as a governor, balanced budgets, created jobs, covered health care, and turned an economy around.In fact, you know, I think that sounds pretty good. But, the truth is, most of America doesn't want to hear another political speech right now and, honestly, I don't blame them.They see enough politics in the nightly news, in the grim statistics of a war gone horribly wrong, a war that is mostly about politics and posturing and saving face. And that's the worst sort of politics imaginable.Our challenge, as Democrats, is not to just break through the voters' cynicism, but also to convince them that we're up to the job that they've entrusted us with.We've won the Congress, but we still have a lot to prove. We need a Democratic nominee who's able to stand up for our principles, our values, make the case to the American people, show them we can get things done, and create a lasting Democratic majority.But I'm tired of hearing the Democrats don't stand for anything. We do. The American people need to know what we're standing up for them and they need to know that we can get the job done.I'm proud to be a Democrat and I'm proud, also, with what we've accomplished in my home state of New Mexico.How many of you have visited New Mexico? Well, the rest of you, get over there.We have created 80,000 new jobs, many of them in high tech industries. We have the lowest unemployment rate since 1978, up to sixth in the nation for job growth, seventh in the nation for personal income growth. And we didn't abandon union families along the way.And one of the first things I did as governor was reinstate collective bargaining for public employees and we secured the first public works labor agreement in New Mexico history, and we made our prevailing wage a union wage.And when it came up to standing for the rights of working people, we didn't compromise our ideals. We acted on them.And to create all those jobs, we first passed a specific tax credit for creating good paying jobs. You pay over the prevailing wage, company, you get a tax credit.We made the rural tax credit permanent. We enacted a three-year tax holiday for high tech startups and we invested state money in local companies that showed great promise for success and job creation.Rather than use tax cuts to reward the wealthy, I used them to reward putting people to work.We balanced the budget. But we also increased school funding by $600 million and we made sure it all went into the classroom and not the bureaucracy. In fact, the first thing we did was give teachers a raise and we've given them a raise every four years.And when I came into office, when I came into office, and I'm really proud of this, we were 46th in teacher pay. With this year's raise, we'll be 27th and we're aiming even higher.You know, our teachers deserve it. Our kids are better off. Our schools are improving. Our parents believe in us again.If we can do that in New Mexico, we can do that across the country.We expanded state health insurance. We offer every child five and under in New Mexico health insurance. We lowered the cost of health care for working families.We're helping small businesses create purchasing pools so they can get the same lower insurance rate as large employers.Two of the bedrock principles of the Democratic Party are equal access to an excellent education and equal access to health care.For too long in this country we've had neither, but we're making great strides in New Mexico and we can do that across the country if we have a Democratic Congress, a Democratic presidential, Democratic governors in a majority of states, and a Democratic mandate to finally lift this country up.And I want to tell you, too, in New Mexico, our fight for equality extends to sexual orientation. For the first time in state history, we have a hate crimes law and we've extended civil rights protections to include sexual orientation and we're providing state health insurance for domestic partnerships.Some call New Mexico the land of enchantment. I now like to think that we live in a state of enlightenment.Finally, Mark Twain said, "Everybody complains about the weather, but nobody ever does anything about it." Is that pretty funny?Well, when it comes to global warming and climate change, we're doing something about it in New Mexico. I set tough standards to reduce greenhouse emissions.Maybe the country and President Bush don't follow the Kyoto Treaty, but my state is on track to not only meet Kyoto, but surpass it.We've invested directly in energy efficiency and no other state has done as much to promote renewable energy with tax credits for wind, solar, bio fuels. We've eliminated taxes on hybrid cars and we're requiring utility companies to start producing energy from renewable sources, 10 percent next year, 15 percent in five years, five years later 20 percent.My state has become the clean energy state and there's no reason why we can't become the clean energy nation, with a man-on-the-moon effort to reduce our dependency on foreign oil.Every one of these accomplishments can be done at the national level. But it's not just enough to win the Congress. We need someone who can win the White House back and can win in every region of this country.And I know the usual wrap on governors, but we don't know anything about foreign affairs. Well, maybe you can say that about certain governors from Texas, but not this governor, not this governor.Last December, I was visited by a delegation of North Koreans. They came to New Mexico seeking my advice before the disarmament talks. They wanted to know how in the world they're supposed to work with an administration that thinks axis of evil is a bargaining position.When I visited Darfur last month, Darfur is a human tragedy that we must all act on with the Save Darfur Coalition, a group of grassroots activists in this country.We negotiated a very fragile cease fire, but I saw thousands of widows and fatherless children trying to escape the genocide, waiting in line in 100 degree heat for a month.And they wanted to know why the international community and the United States was waiting so long to do something. And, you know, the Middle East, they want to know how we can expect to bring peace to the region while shutting out Syria and Iran and not having a Middle East peace envoy.The war in Iraq is not the disease. Iraq is a symptom. The disease is arrogance.The next president, must be able to repair the damage that's been done to our country's reputation over the last six years. It's why experience in foreign affairs has never been more important.But whatever you may think of a preemptive war grounded in the choice reasoning, the clouded reasoning of a vengeful administration and a misled Congress, the reality is we've done in Iraq what we said we would do.We've rid the world of a brutal dictator. We've brought about free and fair elections three times over.The Iraqis now have a constitution, over 200,000 armed soldiers. They have huge oil revenue.It's time for our troops to leave with honor.When it comes to this president, when it comes to this president, I don't know how someone can be so blind to the hurt and anguish in this country and so deaf to the will of the people.This is not presidential greatness. This is a great tragedy. America is better than this.A struggle for human rights is worthy of military intervention. A true threat to our country's security is worthy of war. But a struggle between a country's warring factions where both sides hate the United States is not worthy of one more lost American life.I just told Governor Dean I'm almost finished. He said, "Yeah, right." No, he didn't say that. He said, "That's fine."And by the way, Howard Dean was right in rebuilding our parties in 50 states. He did it.You know, as someone who served in the Congress for 14 years, I know the power they hold, should they choose to wield it. The Congress passed a resolution authorizing war. They need to pass another one that overturns that authorization and brings our troops home by the end of this calendar year.And you would think -- that when the Congress realized they were lied to, they would have done something about it. Well, they still can.Once our troops are heading out, America still has a responsibility. We still have a role to play. We have a moral responsibility to bring the Sunni and Shia together in a national reconciliation conference.And we have a strategic interest in organizing a regional conference with all of Iraq's neighbors, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, NATO, but also include Syria and Iran to help stabilize Iraq.But, more than anything else, America has a moral obligation to those Americans who have laid down their lives. A Native American kid in New Mexico perished 10 days ago, the first Pueblo Native American to die.Some say we can't let their sacrifices be in vain, but you'll never convince me that those slain patriots would have wanted a single additional life to be lost just to validate their own sacrifice.Instead, the moral obligation is to honor their service by bringing their mission to a close, by ending the bloodshed and finally letting the Iraqi people to set their own course.What I've just said to you would be the principles of my presidency. I'm positive about this country. I'm patriotic. I think we can resolve these problems.My only message here is we talk about energy independence, foreign policy, we talk about creating jobs and making lives better for people.The American people want a president who will bring us together as a nation that will heal the wounds. And I submit to you, you know, maybe I'm not up there in all these polls, but you are the deciders, not the man in the White House.And so I say to you today, stay loose, we've got a year to go. Watch us on the trail. The man scrutinized.I want to come to every one of your states and counties -- well, not counties, all your states.Thank you so much. God bless the Democratic Party. God bless the United States. God bless New Mexico, and God bless you.Thank you. Thank you very much for that kind introduction. In recent years, America's foreign policy has been guided more by dogma than by facts, more by ideology than by history. More by wishful thinking than by reality. This administration's lack of realism has led us to a dangerous place. In an era of terrorism, they have squandered our military power, undermined our diplomatic leverage, and depleted our treasury. They have emboldened our enemies and isolated us from our friends. They have confused our moral compass and compromised our national security. We need to take a different path. A path based on reality, not unilateralist illusions. A path that understands that the gravest dangers that threaten us today do not threaten only us -- and that therefore to pursue our national interest and meet these challenges we must work with our friends, our enemies, and everyone in between. This is a path not of hard words, but of hard work. A path of moral strength, not pious judgments. A path of strong diplomacy, backed up by a strong military and strong alliances. This is the path of American leadership. A path that I believe can lead to an Axis of Reason to confront urgent global problems. President Bush doesn't seem to understand that success in foreign policy requires both a strong military and smart diplomacy. Because while diplomacy without power is weak, power without diplomacy is blind. Before I became Governor, I had been a Congressman, America's Ambassador to the United Nations, and Secretary of Energy. Over the past 15 years, I also have led many diplomatic missions where I have stood toe-to-toe with some of the world's toughest customers, including Saddam, Castro, the North Koreans, and, most recently, the Sudanese leader Bashir. I have gotten all these tough guys to do what I wanted them to do because I put my disdain for them aside, and talked to them. You need to know your enemy if you want him to cooperate. I know that even bad guys will listen to you when you hold a big stick in one hand and a carrot in the other -- and you show them a face-saving way out of the dilemma you have just created for them. Talking to people is no guarantee of success, but refusing to talk to them is usually a precursor to failure. As JFK said, we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. I also have worked closely with some extraordinary leaders, such as Bill Clinton, Kofi Annan and Nelson Mandela . I know that great leaders are guided by shining ideals -- but that they are never blinded by ideology. They know that to pursue a vision to make the world a better place, you first must see the world as it really is. To restore American leadership, we need to reject dogma, and to embrace a New Realism in our foreign policy. An enlightened and ethical Realism for the 21st century. A Realism that looks at the world through cool eyes, but that is also inspired by ardent principles. THE NEW REALISM America is a great nation that knows how to defend itself. We are also a nation that has been willing to pay in blood as well as in coin for what we believe is the right thing to do and we have a sense that in order to do right by ourselves, we must be ready to do right by others. We defend ourselves most effectively when we lead others. And it has been our willingness to seek and find common ground, to blend our interests with those of others, which has been the key to our long history of effective leadership. Realists like Truman and Eisenhower understood that defending Europe and ourselves from the Soviets required a strong military. But they also understood that we could not lead our allies if they did not wish to follow. These and subsequent American Presidents knew the importance of moral leadership. Our remarkable military and our prosperous economy gave us the power to lead. But our commitment to human dignity – including our willingness to struggle against our own prejudices -- inspired others to follow. If America is to lead again, we need to remember this history, and to rebuild our overextended military, increase the size of our army, revive our alliances, and restore our reputation as a nation which respects international law, human rights and civil liberties. There is no time to lose. For we live in perilous times, in which policies shaped by fantasy and wishful thinking have already wreaked havoc, and court further disaster. Six trends are transforming our world. We need to understand them, and respond to all of them simultaneously. One trend, of course, is fanatical Jihadism bursting from an increasingly unstable and violent greater Middle East. This trend had been growing for years, but the invasion and collapse of Iraq have fueled its growth. A second trend is the growing power and sophistication of both non-state and state-linked criminal and terrorist enterprises capable of disrupting the global economy and trafficking in weapons of mass destruction. Together these two trends raise the terrible specter of nuclear terrorism. We know that Al Qaeda has tried to get nuclear weapons. We know that Pakistan's A.Q. Khan sold nuclear materials to rogue states, and we know that there are former Soviet nuclear weapons which are poorly-secured. The existence of a black market in nuclear materials is well-documented. The proliferation of nuclear weapons to new countries has increased further the opportunities for Jihadists to obtain them. A third trend transforming our world is the rapid rise of Asian economic and military power, above all in China and India. And a fourth trend is the re-emergence of Russia, as an increasingly assertive global and regional player, with a large nuclear arsenal, control over energy resources -- and tempted by militant nationalism. The simultaneous rise of India, China, and Russia requires our thoughtful attention and strategic leadership, so that these powerful nuclear-armed nations may be integrated into a stable global order. A fifth trend transforming our world is the simultaneous increase in global economic interdependence and financial imbalances -- unaccompanied by the growth of institutional capacities to manage these realities. Globalization has made our economy more vulnerable to resource constraints and financial shocks originating beyond our borders. I am particularly concerned about the possibility of a global energy crisis or a collapse of the US dollar. And the sixth trend we face is that of urgent and worsening health and environmental problems which are truly global in scope. Global warming and pandemics like AIDS do not respect national borders. And poverty, ethnic conflict and overpopulation also spill over borders, feeding what Moises Naim has called the "five wars of globalization" (over drugs, arms trafficking, money laundering, intellectual property and alien smuggling). These six transformative trends present us with problems which are international in their origins and which will require international solutions. And they cry out for American leadership. If the world succeeds in preventing nuclear terrorism, defeating Jihadism, integrating rising powers into a stable order, protecting global financial market stability, and fighting pandemics and global warming, America surely will deserve much of the credit. If the world fails to meet these challenges, America just as surely will deserve much of the blame. We must confront these challenges with ALL our resources -- from our military to our economy to our capacity to inspire others to follow us. This New Realist vision for re-launching American leadership in the 21st century will entail several steps: 1) First and foremost, we must repair our alliances. This means restoring respect and appreciation for our allies, and for the democratic values which unite us. 2) We must renew our commitment to international law and multilateral cooperation. This means expanding the Security Council to reflect international realities, and it means ethical reform at the UN, so that this vital institution can meet the challenges of the 21st century. It means more third world debt relief, and a World Bank focused on poverty-reduction. It means shifting aid from loans to grants for the poorest countries. It means reviving the Doha round of trade talks and seeking agreements which seriously address wage disparities, worker rights, and the environment. It means more resources for the IMF, so that it can protect the international economy from financial panics and shocks. And it means respecting the Geneva conventions and joining the International Criminal Court. The United States once was – and again must be – a human rights example to which others aspire. We must be impeccable in our own behavior, and we must reward countries which respect the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. And we must negotiate, constructively but firmly, with those who do not. Because we care about human rights, we need to start taking Africa seriously. The two most horrendous recent genocides have taken place in Rwanda and now Darfur. History teaches us that if the United States does not take the lead on genocide, no one else will. We need to step up to the plate on Darfur, and let the world know that when genocide threatens, the United States will lead the world to stop it. 3) The United States also must be the leader, not the laggard, in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We must join the Kyoto protocol on global warming, and then go well beyond it. We must lead the world with a man-on-the-moon effort to improve efficiency and to commercialize clean, alternative technologies. We must cut our fossil fuel consumption dramatically and rapidly, and get others, including China and India, to follow us to a sustainable energy future. 4) We need to stop treating diplomatic engagement with others like a reward for good behavior. The Bush administration's refusal to engage obnoxious regimes has only encouraged and strengthened their most paranoid and hard-line tendencies. The futility of this policy is most tragically obvious in regard to Iran and North Korea, who responded to Washington's snubs and threats with intensification of their nuclear programs. American leadership means talking even with regimes we don't like, so that we can show them the real costs and benefits that will result from their choices. Sometimes diplomacy demands that you talk tough. But to do that, you have to at least be talking. We also need to engage Russia and China more effectively, strategically, and systematically than we have, as we encourage them to work with us to build a stable, peaceful world. 5) We need to focus on the real security threats, from which Iraq has so dangerously diverted our attention. This means doing the hard work to build strong coalitions to fight terrorists and to stop nuclear proliferation. Most urgently, we need to lock down ALL of the world's fissionable material. Quickly. Before terrorists get their hands on a nuclear bomb. To accomplish this, we must increase funding for the Nunn-Lugar program to secure former Soviet nuclear weapons. And we must work aggressively with our Pakistani allies to make sure that, no matter what happens in the future, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal cannot fall into the hands of Jihadists. We need better human intelligence and better international intelligence and law enforcement coordination to prevent nuclear trafficking. And we must do the hard diplomatic work to unite the world, including Russia and China, to contain the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea, as we provide these nations with incentives and face-saving ways to renounce nuclear weapons. And if we want other countries to take the nuclear non-proliferation treaty seriously, we need to start taking it seriously ourselves. This means leading a global effort to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world – including our own. And we need to upgrade and tighten the NPT to prevent states from legally developing their nuclear capabilities, and then opting out of the treaty as they rush to build bombs. We also must open an ideological front in the war against Jihadism. There is a civil war within Islam between extremists and moderates -- and we need to stop helping our enemies in that civil war. We need to start showing, both through our words and through our deeds, that this is not, as the Jihadists claim, a clash of civilizations. Rather, it is a clash between civilization and barbarity. We need to present the Arab and Muslim worlds with a better vision than the apocalyptic fantasy of the Jihadists. A vision of peace, prosperity, tolerance, and respect for human dignity. For this to be credible, we need to live up to our own ideals. Prisoner abuse, torture, secret prisons, renditions, and evasion of the Geneva conventions must have no place in our policy. If we want Muslims to open to us, we should start by closing Guantanamo. We also need to pressure Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other friends to reform their education systems -- which five years after 9-11 are still incubators of anti-Americanism. And we must give a louder, more systematic voice to moderate American Muslims, so that they can speak the truth about us and be heard. And we need to re-engage the Middle-East peace process, so that we can deprive the Jihadists of their most effective propaganda tool. We must not waver in our support for Israel, as we use all our sticks and carrots to strengthen Palestinian moderates and to promote a two-state solution. We are spending $2 billion per week on Iraq, but we are not doing nearly enough to protect our cities, nuclear power plants, shipping and ports from terrorist attack. We must spend more to recruit, equip and train more first responders, and we must drastically improve our public health facilities, which five years after 9-11 are not ready for a biological attack. And we need to allocate Homeland Security dollars to where they are neededto the population centers and facilities that we know Al Qaeda targets. It is unpatriotic and irresponsible to turn homeland security dollars into pork. 6) The United States of America also needs to start paying attention to the Americas. To our own back yard. Illegal trafficking of drugs and persons across the Mexican border threaten our national security. We need both better border security and comprehensive immigration reform – reform that provides for a guest worker program with a realistic and earned path to legalization. And we must abandon this notion of building a fence along the border. No fence ever built has stopped history and this one wouldn't either. It just won't work. Let's use that money for real border enforcementand I have proposed doubling the number of border guards to do just that. Real security, real results at the fraction of the financial or political cost of building a fence. And to reduce both illegal immigration and anti-American populism in Latin America, we must work with reform-minded governments to alleviate poverty and promote equitable development. We need to strengthen energy cooperation in the region, as we foster democracy and fair trade. And fostering democracy must include Cuba. We should reverse Bush policies restricting remittances, and travel to visit loved ones. Raul Castro has started to make some overtures toward the United States. Let's challenge him to show his sincerity by releasing Cuban political prisoners. 7) America needs to lead the global fight against poverty – which is the basis of so much violence. We must promote equitable trade agreements, to create more jobs in all countries. And through our example and our diplomacy we must encourage all rich countries honor their UN Millennium goal commitments. A Commission on Implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, composed of world leaders and prominent experts, should be created to recommend ways of meeting Millennium commitments. America needs to lead donors on debt relief, shifting aid from loans to grants, and toward greater focus on primary health care and affordable vaccines. We should pressure pharmaceutical companies to allow expanded use of generic drugs, and we should stimulate public-private partnerships to reduce costs and enhance access to anti-malarial drugs and bed nets. Most importantly, America should spearhead a multilateral Marshall Plan for the Middle East and North Africa. For a small fraction of the cost of the Iraq war, which has made us so many enemies, we could make many friends. A crucial effort in fighting terrorism must be support for public education in the Muslim world, which is the best way to mitigate the role of madrasas that foment extremism. Development alleviates the injustice and lack of opportunity that proponents of violence and terrorism exploit. To those who say we cannot afford an aid program to build pro-American sentiment in the developing world, I say we cannot afford not to. The challenges facing America today are great. We need to learn from the failures of the Bush administration, open our eyes, and see the world as it is – so that we can lead others to make it a better, safer place. This is the New Realist vision for the new century. I believe we can do it. America can earn back the respect, trust, and admiration of the world. We can and will once again be the respected leader of nations. Our national security and our future depend upon it. Thank you very much. Thank you for that kind introduction. Some may wonder why a Governor from a state that actively promotes renewable and alternative energy would come to speak to a conference dedicated to Oil and Gas.But the same reason why I'm talking to you todayis the same principle I've always held. It's OK to talk.Sometimes talks yield littlean agreement to disagree. But, sometimes direct talks work. Direct talks mean looking across a political or philosophical divide to find common ground and to build a better solution. As a Democratic Governor in a red-state it's something I'm familiar with. I think some Democrats may not recognize that its business that creates jobs and builds an economy. But not this DemocratI'm a pro-business, tax-cutting Governor and I would remain the same as President. Today, I'd like to talk to you about the threats to America's energy security, and our generation's challenge to build a new economy based on clean energy. This is my vision--some parts you may agree with---some parts you won'tbut afterwards we can talk it through. Energy is central to US Foreign policy. It's easy to say the US is addicted to oil. Understanding the stranglehold of that addiction – and constructively working to end our "habit" – is hard. Oil is a strategic commodity often controlled by repressive governments. Production levels – and price – are strongly influenced by a global cartel. Oil dependence is America's Achilles-heel, and it's allowed our foreign policy to go weak in the knees. Our oil addiction limits our power to deter Iran's Nuclear Program, to challenge Russia when it behaves badly, to respond effectively to anti-American rhetoric from Venezuela's president, to push for reform in Nigeria, or to build a coalition to stop the genocide in the Sudan. And our options in Iraq are constrained by the fear that Iraq's vast oil reserves could fall under the influence of Iran. And while America's last two wars in the Middle East weren't only about oilour dependence on oil is too often the unspoken subtext that compels us to act and causes others to view our foreign policy with suspicion. As everyone in this room knowsgrowing energy demand in Asia, coupled with already high consumption levels in the developed world, has launched a race for control of the world's ever-scarcer energy resources. Also, there are few new, large discoveries of oil in the world. Development of pristine areas like ANWR or Otero Mesa in my home state, will yield relatively little oil – not nearly enough to alter the inevitable reality of higher prices due to increased demand and finite supply.This scenario is already evident. The average family will spend $3,500 on fuel in 2007almost double what they spent only six years ago. Almost 70% of the world's oil reserves are concentrated in the Middle East or in OPEC nations. The cartel's ability to control oil prices leaves consumers, investors and policy makers perpetually off-balance: Oil price volatility with highs and lows so divergent that they either stunt the world economy, or kill investment in and development of alternative fuels.But while significant, this is not my greatest concern. Instead, as we fight the war on terror, I most fear a more immediate and fundamental strategic reality of our oil addiction: a significant portion of the $450 billion petrodollars we export each year is most certainly funneled to fund our Jihadist enemies. As such, I think it's time we acknowledged this simple truth: Our ability to drain the swamps of terrorism depends in part on our political will to change how we produce, distribute and consume energy. But funding our enemies with exported oil revenues is not my only concern. The other result of our oil and energy addiction – climate change – also has global, strategic implications. Scientists use the term "disruptive impacts" to describe what climate change could mean to the nations and regions of the world. I think it's time we stopped using this sterile euphemism and instead acknowledge what this really means – severe weather, flooding and drought and the alterations of agricultural production, rising sea levels, new disease patterns, widespread economic dislocations and destruction and a host of other problems that threaten the community of nations. As the Governor of New Mexicoa growing and prosperousdesert state, I must pay attention to this threat and what it means for our scarce water resources.In the West, it's not just the liberal college kids who ask what we are doing about global warmingit's the conservative farmers and ranchers whose way of living is at risk. And like the rest of America, we can't afford to gamble that the vast majority of the scientific community is somehow wrong on global warming---especially as our country remains the largest producer of greenhouse gases and is on track to double its emissions in the next 50 years. The surer betis to do what's right to slow, stop, and reverse global warming. Believe it or not, there is common ground between Democrats and a number of Republicans on energy policylike conservation, promoting renewable fuels, and addressing global warming. But while the Bush administration has begun to recognize the global warming threat, there is a gap between rhetoric and policy. In the same year President Bush admitted "America is addicted to oil," he has missed deadlines to release new efficiency regulations, resisted higher gas mileage standards, and chose instead to subsidize gas-guzzling Hummers and SUVs. President Bush also said "we need to reduce our reliance on foreign energy sources." But he is pursuing a policy course that will make the U.S. as dependent on those same countries for natural gas that currently hold the world hostage to their oil reserves. The 2005 Energy Bill streamlines the development of a global LNG market. We should not lose sight of the following however: Forty-five percent of the world's proved gas reserves are in just two countries – Russia and Iran. Consider the geopolitical implications of that relationship. Further, almost two thirds of the world's proved gas reserves are in either OPEC nations or Russia. Again, the proximity of these gas supply centers to the consuming regions of Europe and Asia, put US LNG consumers at a distinct price and supply line disadvantage.If all the LNG re-gasification terminals approved by this administration since 2005 were built and operating at full capacity, we would be importing almost sixty percent of our natural gas, in addition to an even higher percentage of our oil.It's true that in the near to mid-term, we need additional supplies of clean burning natural gas – it can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the near- to mid-term. Also, 60 million Americans heat their homes with natural gas – affordable supplies of gas mean lower heating bills for our families and businesses.But we need to be mindful of the geopolitical realities of the LNG marketplace. Also, natural gas end use efficiency and environmentally-sensitive production of technically recoverable domestic reserves will substantially reduce the need for LNG imports. Strict building efficiency measures alone – using currently available technologies – would decrease gas consumption and dramatically lower carbon emissions over the next several decades.As a former Secretary of Energy and as the governor of an oil and gas producing state, I've come to know some of the needs of your industry. Energy companies and investors base decisions, not on political terms of two, four or eight years, but in generational terms of 30 years or more. I don't believe your industry fears change. But to make the billion and trillion dollar energy infrastructure and resource development investments---you don't need a conflicted vision of next year---you need leadership and consistent vision of the next fifty years.I believe it's time for America to get off of its knees and stand up for a new energy future. We should lead the world in reducing greenhouse gasses and in preparing for the post-oil economy of the future. Gradually, but deliberately, we can wean ourselves of our oil addiction. This is not a task government can do alone. Government's role – indeed its obligation-- is to provide a clear vision, strategic investment in technology development, incentives to move forward – and most importantly, legal and regulatory certainty. You are responsible for managing incredible risk and high-dollar portfolios – you have every right to know the federal "rules of the road" as you make key investments in our energy future.Government investment in new technologies can serve as a sparkplug for energy "invention" but it is the role of the investment community to transform those inventions to marketplace "innovations" -- and the role of the business community to move innovations from the business plan stage to true technology diffusion. Only when government and industry work together as partners can we successfully link together all these pieces of the energy innovation chain -- pushing the nation beyond the tired divisions of "good jobs OR the environment" and moving to "even better jobs AND a clean environment." But for any solution to work, it must be both market- and reality-based. We should set bold standards, but use incentives to bring along consumers and the private sector.And we should use tax credits to ease the path for lower income groups and small businesses.I have never feared using tax-cuts and tax-credits to unleash the power of the private sector.In New Mexico, we've cut over $1 billion in taxes, invested into high-tech job creating companies, and created tax credits for companies that provide high-wage jobs. Today, 84,000 more New Mexicans are working, and incomes are on the rise. • We became the first state to join the Chicago Climate exchange and signed an agreement with California, Arizona, Oregon and Washington to set greenhouse gas reduction goals and use a market-based system to achieve them. • We're requiring utilities to start producing energy from renewable resourcesto generate 10 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2011 and 20% by 2020. • We used tax credits for solar, wind and biomass to attract some of the most innovative renewable energy businesses in the worldto New Mexico. • And we are creating the country's first renewable energy transmission authorityso we can buy and sell renewable energy to interested states. New Mexico's economy is bolstered by its oil and gas production. We've consistently invested production revenues into bettering our schools, improving our infrastructure, diversifying our economy -- and laying out a series of incentives to wean us from our addiction to oil. • We've opened one of the largest bio-diesel plants in the country, we've increased the production of ethanol by a factor of six, and we're about to set new standards for bio-fuel content in gasoline. • We eliminated taxes on hybrid cars, and are now the new home of TeslaAmerica's first large-scale production site for electric cars. New Mexico is becoming the clean energy state. There's no reason why the United States cannot become the clean energy nation. I'd like to lay out a part of my vision for regaining America's energy security---a combined program of business innovation and government investment comparable in scale to the Manhattan project to split the atom, or the Apollo Project to put a man on the moon. Our goal should be boldto reduce oil imports by 40% AND replace one quarter of liquid fuels with bio-fuels by 2025, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 75% by 2050. 1. Conservation and Efficiency programsOpportunities for efficiencies abound – from the fuel consumed in the vehicles we drive to the energy used to power our homes, appliances, factories, and office buildings. We know that our economy is about half as energy –efficient as Japan or Western Europe's. Indeed, improving efficiency is the single-most important way to cut our oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.That's why as Energy Secretary, I set new standards of energy efficiency, for buildings and appliances. Those standards represent carbon reductions equivalent to taking one million cars off the road. Automobile efficiency has actually declined over the last 20 years – this is unacceptable. We should be rewarding auto manufacturers for building and selling cars that use less fuel and establish one uniform Corporate Average Fuel Economy for all vehicles. By using lighter but stronger material to build our cars, by increasing engine efficiency and by increasing the use of hybrids and other advanced technologies, we could get America's car fleet to 50 miles per gallon in the next 10 years. We can also reduce our energy and net emissions by 5 percent next year, and then an additional two percent each year thereafter, by: • Strengthening energy efficiency building codes. • Enacting stronger national appliance efficiency standards. • Establishing National Carbon Sequestration Goals. And Government should lead by example. In New Mexico, not only did we put forward new standards for energy efficient buildings, but we also issued green building tax credits. We should set a goal of cutting the federal government's energy bill by 20 percent by 2010 and challenge municipalities, corporations, universities, and hospitals to do the same.And our tax system should make this easier for everyone to do the right thingthat includes: • Expanded tax breaks for energy efficient building and retrofits • Tax credits for hybrid cars and public transportation passes, not for hummers and SUVs • And the creation of a system of tradable emission credits to encourage private companies to invest in conservation and clean alternative energy technologies. 2. We must expand the use of Alternative and Renewable Energy SourcesThe 2005 federal energy bill included a nationwide renewable fuels standard (RFS) that will double the use of ethanol and biodiesel by 2012. This is a good start, but it does not go far enough to increase production of renewable, domestic fuels. We need a more aggressive national goal of producing 20 percent of our transportation fuels from renewable sources by 2020, and an incentive program to make it happen.More specifically, we should fund cutting edge bio-fuels research and provide incentives for its distribution by, for example, helping gas stations convert at least one pump to handle E 85 or other bio-fuels.The federal government also should use its vast purchasing power to transform the energy marketplace by, for example, purchasing more hybrid and flex fuel cars for its own use – providing a huge guaranteed market for efficient vehicles. Finally, we should significantly ramp up federal investments in research and development and dramatically improve its effectiveness, starting with some kind of funding certainty over time to make the government more attractive and reliable to its industry research partners. As a Western Governor, I know that energy companies pay royalties to extract fossil fuels. Rather than deposit such royalties into general revenues, those earnings should be invested in cutting edge research and development of alternatives and renewable energy. We should also focus less on incremental improvements of current technologies and more on innovations that are truly "disruptive" – transformational technologies.Technologies that will provide for alternative transportation fuels including bio-fuels from switch grass and other plant matter, dramatically enhanced energy efficiency, carbon free power generation, and the affordable capture and sequestration of carbon from the production and consumption of fossil fuels. We also need to change the focus of federal research from "fuels" to "consumers" – only with consumers in mind can we comprehensively address affordability, the environment, infrastructure replacement and transformation, end use efficiency, as well as fuel sources. I would also specifically carve out a new program of federal investment in "Early-Stage Technology Development" to help bridge the gap between "invention and innovation." Too often the federal government stops short because it is "commercialization-averse" and venture capitalists don't pick up the ball because they are "risk-averse." Effectively bridging this "valley of death" is essential to our energy future. In New Mexico, we've been working on it in cases like Advent Solar, where the state government has helped move their solar cells from the research phase at the national laboratories into to the renewable energy marketplace. Indeed, state governments are critical players in this piece of the technology development chain. Finally, we should provide a central point of policy focus in the federal government – perhaps within the White House – to provide for greater rationalization of energy policy, research and development, and investment certainty. 3. Lastly, I believe America should integrate our foreign policy with our energy policy.President Clinton used to send me in to negotiate the freedom of American hostages and political prisoners.He'd say "Send Richardson, bad guys like him."(I don't know if that's true) But I was often asked to negotiate directly with tough characters like Fidel Castro, North Korean generals, Omar Al-Bashir of Sudan, and Saddam Hussein.Those face-to-face talks often meant the difference between the wrongful imprisonment of American servicemen and citizens--- and freedom. I think we need the same sort of strong and focused diplomacy with friend and foe to adapt our foreign policy to the global nature of energy. We should start by strengthening our North American partnership. Energy is a key component of our relationship with Canada and Mexico. Together, we should establish a North American Energy Councilboth to assure that we are efficiently developing and transporting energy in the North American market and to leverage our combined market power.We should then use this partnership to engage a broader hemispheric energy strategy. President Bush's trip to South America, while welcome, may be too little, too late to provide this Administration with any meaningful energy policy focus in its remaining days in office.This is unfortunate. Reserves of tar sands and heavy oil in Canada and Venezuela are roughly double the entire oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. Brazil's experience with ethanol markets and infrastructure could provide valuable lessons to our developing industry. Mexico and Bolivia have large, undeveloped reserves of natural gas.Trinidad Tobago, the largest single US supplier of Liquified Natural Gas has very limited gas reserves and will ultimately be supplying its liquefaction infrastructure with natural gas from Venezuela. Each of these energy opportunities comes with own set of problems – diplomatic, environmental, domestic politics, to name a few. Steady, sustained engagement of our neighbors, however – be they friends or adversaries -- is critical to meeting the energy and environmental needs of the 21st century.Now, the best partthe conclusion. Last week a former CIA director noted that a recent attack on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia was carried out by Al Qaeda. Had they been successfuloil would have hit $100 per barrel and the impact to the US and world economy would have been devastating. We can't afford not to change.And in terms of Global Warming, we must ask everyonecitizens, government and businesses--to do their part to dramatically reduce their emissions. This doesn't just make sense for our air; it's good business. BP estimates it has saved $600 million to $1 billion over the last several years by addressing climate change and methane loss. So, indeed we can afford to change. Change might even be good for the weather and good for the wallet.Thank you.I'd be happy to take your questions. INTRODUCTION Thank you George for that kind introduction. I spent a lot of time watching you on Star Trek during college, maybe a little too much. What a great show with a message of a future of diversity and inclusion. And as Sulu, you literally set the course for that ship. It is truly an honor to speak to the Human Rights Campaign's Annual Black Tie Gala here in Los Angeles. I'd like to thank co-chairs Brian Pendleton and Heidi Schulz for inviting me to speak. And -- while I've been on his show before -- I'd love to be on it again, so let me also be the first to congratulate tonight's Equality Award winner, Bill Maher. Let me also recognize a crusader for respect and equal rights under the law, HRC President Joe Solmonese, whose leadership and support have been crucial for my New Mexico initiatives. DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS I need to admit something; it wasn't easy for me to be here tonight. Not because of the issues -- I am proud to stand with the Human Rights Campaign, for domestic partner rights and against discrimination of any kind. And you will never have to prod me to make a stand with you, to do what is right for you and your families. No, it was hard because I called my legislature back into special session on Tuesday and I need to be there to keep pushing my agenda, including a Domestic Partner Rights Act. It lost by one vote in the Senate -- on the last night of the session -- just eight nights ago. And the next day, with the legislature adjourning until next year, we thought we had secured one more vote -- but couldn't get it to the floor. So I said -- not good enough. Even though we had an incredibly productive session -- we raised the minimum wage to $7.50, we ended predatory lending, we required our utilities to get 20% of their energy from renewable resources, we passed medical marijuana -- I said not good enough. You've got to come back, and along with a few other things, send me domestic partnerships so I can sign it now -- this year. I'm pushing this bill so hard because I believe all families deserve our respect no matter their race, creed or sexual orientation. I think people realize that this bill is a victory for fairness and equality, as well as for open hearts and open minds. Unfortunately, my State Senate so far has not agreed. But I am going to keep pushing. This bill is as important to me as it is to you. So I hope you'll excuse me for leaving after my speech. I'm catching a flight back to New Mexico as soon as I'm done here tonight. I've got work to do. PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE This bill also illustrates the key reason I am running for President. I don't just take votes and debate issues, I get things done. I know your two top priorities this year are passing federal hate crime and workplace discrimination legislation. I don't just support these bills. We have already done this in New Mexico. OTHER STATE ACTIONS In my very first legislative session in 2003, right after I was elected Governor, I fought for, passed and signed:  The first hate crimes law in New Mexico history. Legislation extending civil rights protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. I think we won that one by 1 vote. I ordered that access to health insurance and benefits be extended to the domestic partners of state employees.  And now I am fighting for full and equal rights for all domestic partners, including gay and lesbian families.  I have also appointed gay and lesbian individuals to important posts throughout my administration -- to Cabinet posts, Division Directors, and to powerful boards and commissions. And I'll do the same as President, leading an Administration that truly looks like America. I did all this in what is normally called a "red state." With the right leadership, you can get these things done. Working together, we can accomplish the same on the national level. But before you cast your lot with any national candidate, you have to ask -- not just do they talk the talk -- but do they walk the walk? Can they get it done? As a Governor -- I get things done. NATIONAL CLIMATE My state, New Mexico, and the West more generally, has always been a region that respects individual rights. What is changing in that this "live and let live" attitude is now being extended to issues of sexual orientation, and it's spreading from Hawaii to Maine, and from Los Angeles to Albuquerque. I applaud this shift and I am proud to be a part of moving it forward. This country is tired of the politics of hatred and division. Fed up with Karl Rove's machinations and Ann Coulter's ignorant epithets. Fed up with Ann Coulter period, actually. If the last election showed us anything, it revealed that what voters want is a positive, inclusive vision for the future. One that respects all Americans who work hard and try to do what is best for their families. This inclusive optimism was what allowed us to win back Congress and take a majority of the Governorships in 2006, and it will be crucial to winning the White House in 2008. I know what it takes to win across this country -- in Iowa and in New Hampshire (two states I just picked at random) -- because I was the Chairman of the Democratic Governor's Association last year who helped win these Governor races. And the Human Rights Campaign was a key ally in these successes as well as in Colorado, Maryland, Massachusetts and Wisconsin. Thank you for your great help. We now have 28 Democratic Governors representing 295 Electoral votes. That's another message I have tonight. Governor's can win. We have Democratic Governors in some of the reddest states in the country -- Oklahoma, Wyoming, Montana, Arizona, Kansas, Tennessee. Democratic Governors can compete anywhere in this country -- and, if I might be so bold, it might be a good idea to nominate a Democratic Governor to take back the White House next year. On the coasts and in the heartland, the mainstream of this country wants a leader that can bring them together and help move us toward a better future. That's my message. As a Latino, I have known in my life what it is to be different -- to be singled out. And, throughout my entire career I have fought against discrimination -- in Congress, at the United Nations, as Energy Secretary, and now as Governor of New Mexico. With your help, that's what I will do as your President. DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL And finally, as your President I will also end our disastrous, disrespectful "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. Once again I am no latecomer to this issue. I voted against this when I was in Congress and I continue to oppose it today. It makes no sense to turn away and turn out well-qualified recruits, at a time when our country needs them most. There are currently an estimated 65,000 gay and lesbian soldiers serving in our military. They are no less patriotic and their lives and sacrifices are no less valuable because of their sexual orientation. And the approximately one million homosexual veterans -- including Marine Staff Sergeant Eric Alva, who is here with us tonight -- you deserve our thanks, not a lecture. Homosexuality is not immoral, asking someone to hide their identity and devaluing their sacrifice is. CONCLUSION Gay and lesbian families deserve respect, and as President, I will take a principled stand with you to fight for it. We don't need constitutional amendments designed to exclude supportive, devoted couples. We need to extend the rights due to all of us as Americans:  The right to visit a sick or dying partner in the hospital,  The right to make necessary legal and financial decisions when a partner can no longer do so,  The right to equal employment opportunity, and  The right to protection from violent prejudice.   I have spent my career moving this agenda forward because it is the right thing to do. And with your support, I will continue to do so as President. Thank you. Thank you for that kind introduction. In the 20th century, nuclear deterrence worked. In the 21st century, it won't. Mutually Assured Destruction deterred the Soviet Union, but nothing will stop suicidal Jihadists from using a nuclear bomb if they get their hands on one. If Al Qaeda obtained nuclear weapons, they could smuggle them into American cities - and they would not hesitate to use them with the same ruthlessness that allowed them to fly airplanes filled with people into buildings filled with people. We know that Al Qaeda wants nuclear weapons. We also know that Pakistan's A.Q. Khan sold nuclear materials to rogue states. We know that parts of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal still are not secure, and that there are poorly-secured nuclear materials around the world. The proliferation of nuclear weapons to new countries, above all to North Korea and Pakistan, has increased further the opportunities for Jihadists to obtain them, as has the diffusion of nuclear energy technologies that can be converted to weapons programs. Iran, a nation with close ties to the world's most skilled terrorist organization, Hezbollah, may be on the verge of entering the nuclear club. And Al Qaeda has said that they wish to kill 4 million Americans, including 2 million children. In their madness, they claim that such a slaughter of innocents would "balance the scales of justice," for crimes that they allege we have committed against Muslims. We would be mad not to take them at their word. You may have heard me speak elsewhere about the need for what I call a "New Realism" in American foreign policy. By this I mean that we need to wake up and see that the greatest threats we face today, from global warming to terrorism, do not face only us - and that this means that unilateral action usually will not work. To defend ourselves in the 21st century, we may occasionally need to act alone, but usually we must work with others. Building and leading strong international coalitions should be our first thought when we face common challenges -- not an afterthought when our unilateral course has failed. A New Realism for the 21st century also understands that many threats today come not from states, but rather from societies, including our own society. Not from armies massing or nation states targeting us with missiles, but rather from complex social trends - such as our own consumption of fossil fuels. Not so much from hostile states as from hostile individuals, empowered by their willingness to kill and die for fanatical beliefs. Of course, we must rebuild our military and be prepared to use it when we must -- but we also must reject the unilateralist illusions of recent years. Our remarkable military power gives us the ability to lead. But others follow us not because we intimidate them with the argument of our power, but because we inspire them with the power of our arguments. Defending ourselves from new dangers requires new thinking, new strategies and new tactics. We need to adapt our ideas about national security to an age in which the nuclear threat come not from a missile, but from a suitcase or a cargo hull. Not from a nation, which can be deterred by the threat of retaliation, but from a shadowy terrorist network with no return address. That a small group of stateless terrorists could destroy New York or Washington with a black-market nuclear bomb epitomizes just how much the world has changed -- and how urgent it is that we lead other nations with a comprehensive global plan to lock down ALL of the world's fissionable material. Quickly. Before terrorists get their hands on a nuclear bomb. And I would add another point: meeting the challenge of nuclear terrorism is not just a national security imperative for the United States - it also is a moral imperative. We created the first atomic bombs -- because we feared that Hitler would get them first. We are the only country that ever has used them - to end World War II. During the Cold War, we and the Soviets built enough thermonuclear weapons to destroy all human life on the planet several times over. For six decades, all of humanity has lived with the knowledge that everything we know could end in a flash of light. America led the world into the age of nuclear fear because we were compelled to do so by totalitarian enemies. We now have the urgent moral duty to lead the world out of the age of nuclear fear -- ironically because we confront a very new and different kind of totalitarian enemy. I was Energy Secretary under President Clinton. My department was responsible for the design, manufacture and maintenance of our stockpile of nuclear weapons. These weapons are not abstractions to me: to see one of them is to be astounded that millions of deaths can be compressed into such a tiny package. To know intimately our nuclear arsenal is to know intimately how our species could destroy itself. Sam Nunn put it succinctly: "At the dawn of a new century, we find ourselves in a new arms race. Terrorists are racing to get weapons of mass destruction; we ought to be racing to stop them." This is an existential problem. It is urgent. We need to free humanity from the threat of nuclear destruction. The United States cannot do this alone. But it certainly cannot be done without American leadership. I believe that if we give this matter the attention it deserves, we CAN prevent a nuclear 9-11. The reason I am optimistic is because there is a finite amount of fissionable material in the world, and making it is well beyond the capability of terrorist groups. Therefore, if we lock down all the nuclear weapons and bomb-grade material which exist - and also make sure that all future nuclear fuel and spent-fuel is secure -- we CAN prevent what former Assistant Secretary of Defense Graham Allison has called "the ultimate preventable catastrophe." Securing all the world's nukes will be a huge task -- but not an impossible one. A lot of good things already have been done. The 1992 Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Program has deactivated and destroyed hundreds of missiles and thousands of warheads, and has improved security for much of the former Soviet arsenal. And the Bush administration has done some good things, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative, the Global Threat Initiative, and the 2005 Bratislava accord between Bush and Putin on nuclear security. When I was Energy Secretary under President Clinton, DOE also did many things to secure Russian nukes. We increased funding - from $85 million to $138 million -- for DOE's Material Protection, Control and Accounting program, to protect Russian nuclear warheads and weapons-grade fissile material from falling into the hands of terrorists or black market dealers. I also signed the implementing agreement for the MPC&ampA program, which put the program on a secure footing with the Russians. And we got an emergency $200 million supplemental to dispose of Russian weapons-usable plutonium. We worked closely with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy to determine how to use these funds to eliminate 34 tons of Russian plutonium. But I am sorry to say that the Bush Administration got entangled in delays and conflicts with the Russians -- and still has not spent this $200 million. Those 34 tons of plutonium are still there - and now it even appears that funding is in danger in Congress. I strongly urge Congress to fund this important nonproliferation program. During my tenure at DOE, our Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI) actually got the Russians to agree to close down their Avangard nuclear weapons plant, as we funded the transition of displaced weapons workers to non-military jobs. This was money well spent to protect America and the world. We should have expanded this program, but instead the Bush Administration allowed the NCI agreement to lapse when it came up for renewal in 2003. Indeed, before 9-11 the Bush administration even planned to kill both the plutonium disposition program and the Nuclear Cities Initiative, and to this day they continue to under-fund both programs. Meanwhile, we are spending $10 billion a month on Iraq. Of the many ways in which Mr. Bush's ill-conceived war has distracted us from our real national security needs, this is the most dangerous. We must do more -- much more -- to secure Russian nuclear materials. At of the end of FY 2005, U.S.-funded security and accounting upgrades had been completed for barely half of former Soviet at-risk sites - leaving many sites vulnerable even to relatively unsophisticated terrorists or traffickers. And even the upgraded buildings remain vulnerable to well-trained attackers -- of the sort we have seen in action in Russia in recent years. We need more rapid progress in consolidating nuclear weapons and materials into a smaller number of sites, and in making sure that every site is secure. We and the Russians also should take our nuclear weapons off hair-trigger alert status. Not only is this Cold War relic unnecessary today, but it also prevents us from securing all of the Russian arsenal, as they don't want to provide us with total information on their nuclear weapons when we have thousands of our own ready to be launched at them on a minute's notice. The situation in some other parts of the world is even more dangerous than in Russia. In several countries, civilian nuclear facilities often are less secure than a grocery store, and even weapons-grade nuclear materials are vulnerable to theft. Pakistan's weapons are the most likely to fall into the wrong hands. They could be raided by Al Qaeda groups or sold by insiders. And we cannot exclude the possibility that Jihadists could come to power. We need to work, perhaps quietly, with General Musharraf to insure that, in the event of a coup, Jihadists would not be able to use the Pakistani nuclear arsenal. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative has accelerated the removal of nuclear materials from sites around the world, but huge security gaps remain. Indeed, two-thirds of U.S.-supplied highly enriched uranium (HEU) still is not covered by the U.S. take-back offer, and there are too many reactors in the world still using bomb-grade fuel. A COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL PLAN We CAN do better. We CAN prevent the ultimate preventable catastrophe and end the era of nuclear fear. But we need to really focus on it, and do the hard work that needs to be done. It is a question of commitment, of leadership. Of not taking our eyes off the ball. As I said, some good things have already been done -- but they have been piecemeal and inadequate. It took a Manhattan project to create the bomb. We need a new Manhattan project to stop the bomb: a comprehensive program to secure all nuclear weapons and all weapons-usable material, worldwide. The United States must lead a global coalition to establish effective, universal nuclear security standards that reduce the number of nuclear weapons, and make sure that those that exist are safe from theft or diversion. We also must secure all fissionable material associated with nuclear energy and research, with a "global clean-out," which removes all weapons-grade material world-wide from vulnerable sites, and consolidates it into a limited number of highly-secure facilities. A comprehensive strategy must focus on four key tasks. If we accomplish them all, it is unlikely that terrorists will get a nuclear weapon. If we fail to do them, sooner or later they will. We need to:  halt nuclear weapons proliferation  halt nuclear weapons production and reduce the size of nuclear arsenals  halt or secure civilian programs that require or produce bomb-grade materials  consolidate and secure all existing fissile materials and all future production associated with nuclear energy and research worldwide  The first task, halting nuclear weapons proliferation, is urgent and immediate -- because we are on the edge of a precipice with North Korea and Iran. If we don't stop them, several other nations, especially their neighbors, may decide to go nuclear as well. And the more states that have nuclear weapons, the greater the risk that terrorists will acquire them. In dealing with difficult regimes like Iran and North Korea, we must remember that no nation has ever been forced to renounce nuclear weapons - but that many nations have been convinced to renounce them. If we unite the world behind the right carrots and sticks, and provide the North Koreans and the Iranians with face-saving ways to step back from the nuclear brink, we will prevail. Some good steps have been taken recently, and there are signs that we may succeed. Meaningful sanctions accompanied by positive incentives and security guarantees lessen the paranoia and strengthen the pragmatists. The key is convincing these regimes that they will be more secure without nuclear weapons than with them. To convince them, we absolutely need Russia and China. To implement the recent agreement with North Korea, and to get them to dismantle the devices they already have, China is the key. To stop Iran from enriching uranium, its Russia. Whenever the UN Security Council is involved, we need both Russia and China. This is why the current administration's allergy to strategic diplomacy has been so destructive. If we had threatened the Iranians and North Koreans less, talked to them more, and built stronger relations with the other great powers, the world would be a safer place today. We need to get back on the diplomatic track, and stay there, if we are to prevent further nuclear proliferation. We also need to strengthen the NPT regime, which has been weakened in recent years, as India and Pakistan and North Korea have gone nuclear, and as Iran attempts to do so. We need a new global non-proliferation agreement which prevents states from developing nuclear fuel-enrichment capabilities, and then abandoning the NPT as they rush to make bombs. We also need to negotiate a tough universal verification system that gives international inspectors immediate and unfettered access to all sites, worldwide. Getting all nations to agree to a stronger nonproliferation regime will require skillful diplomacy and new thinking. Which brings me to the second task: the nuclear states must stop making new weapons and must reduce the size of their existing arsenals. The Non-Proliferation Treaty commits non-nuclear states to forego nuclear weapons, and it also commits the nuclear weapons states to the goal of nuclear disarmament. To get others to take the NPT seriously, we need to take it seriously ourselves. We should re-affirm our commitment to the long-term goal of global nuclear disarmament, and we should invite the Russians to join us in a moratorium on all new nuclear weapons. And we should negotiate further staged reductions in our arsenals, beyond what has already been agreed, over the next decade. In a world in which nuclear terrorism rather than war with Russia is the main threat, reducing all nuclear arsenals, in a careful, orderly way, makes everyone safer. Negotiations to reduce our arsenal also are our diplomatic ace-in-the-hole. We can leverage our own proposed reductions to get the other nuclear powers to do the same -- and simultaneously get the non-nuclear powers to forego both weapons and nuclear fuel enrichment, and to agree to rigorous global safeguards and verification procedures. The United States also should ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, not only because it is good policy, but also to send a signal to the world that America has turned a corner, and once again will be a global leader, not a unilateralist loner. Our third task is to put the lid on the most dangerous civilian technologies. Currently, there are over 50 tons of HEU in civilian power and research programs in over 50 nations. It takes as little as 25 kg to produce a nuclear weapon. There are no fewer than 272 operational research reactors, in 56 countries. Some 128 of these have 20 kg or more of HEU stocks. Many are poorly secured. Civilian plutonium is even more worrisome. Commercial reprocessing plants in Britain, France, and Russia separate about 20 tons of civilian plutonium from spent fuel each year, but most of it is not used as civilian reactor fuel. Rather, it accumulates -- as do the risks of it falling into the wrong hands. Today there are well over 200 tons of separated plutonium in civilian stockpiles around the world. This is a catastrophe waiting to happen. We need to close down or phase out as many of these facilities as we can, and rapidly secure all materials of potential interest to terrorists. Negotiations to accomplish this will be very difficult, but a comprehensive strategy to stop nuclear terrorism must, at a minimum, stop the construction of new facilities that use bomb-grade fuel, and establish rigorous international security standards and monitoring procedures for those facilities that already exist. Our fourth task is to consolidate all existing fissile materials, and all future uranium enrichment and spent-fuel disposal in a limited number of highly secure facilities in the nuclear states. Uranium enrichment for nuclear energy is inherently dangerous. It is too easy to convert into a weapons program, and the more places it happens, the more opportunities there are for terrorists to acquire fissile material. Accordingly, the nuclear weapons states should agree to an international program that provides non-nuclear weapons states with LEU nuclear fuel at stable prices, and which then receives all spent fuel for disposal in a limited number of highly secure facilities in the nuclear states. Such a program would eliminate the economic rationale for non-nuclear weapons states to enrich their own uranium. The obstacles to accomplishing these multiply goals are many and intertwined. To prevent nuclear terrorism we will need to overcome vested interests, old suspicions and habits, ideological rigidities, religious and ethnic rivalries, bureaucratic inertia and national pride. The only way to cut this nuclear Gordian Knot, in my view, will be through a focused global effort led by a United States government fully committed to solving this problem, and willing to listen as well as to talk. And this will require American leaders who recognize that the nuclear postures and policies which worked in the last century will not work in this new century. Some have said that nuclear terrorism is just inevitable - that we can never put the lid back on the Pandora's Box of nuclear technology. They are right that we cannot turn back the clock. But we can greatly reduce the risk of nuclear terrorism, just as the 1925 the Geneva Protocol greatly reduced the use of chemical and biological weapons, and Cold War arms talks reduced the threat of war between the US and the USSR. We can prevent the ultimate preventable catastrophe if we have the courage to recognize and embrace the challenge. This is what the New Realism is all about. It's about not denying dangers, but rather moving forward to meet them. It's about recognizing that times have changed, that we live in a different world than our parents did -- and that we must act decisively if we wish to leave this world intact to our children. We need to look at the world through cool eyes and see it for what it really is. But we also must have the vision and the optimism and the courage to do what we can to make it a safer place." David, thank you for that kind introduction. I would like to talk to you today about the future of US-Asian relations. Because we have choices to make, and the stakes are very high. Both Asians and non-Asians will make decisions in the coming years that determine whether our future is one of common endeavor or of geo-political tension. Whether our economies prosper together or stagnate separately behind protectionist walls. Whether we tackle urgent common challenges like global warming, or fail to act.To build a future of cooperation rather than contention, we need to be realistic. There will always be rivalry among great powers, and nations always will have, at times, conflicting interests and different values. We cannot eliminate all rivalries and conflicts and differences, but we can choose to be judicious and far-sighted in how we manage them. There are steps we can take, and I am here today to share with you my vision for the future of U.S.-Asian Relations.  The United States should lead Asia toward balanced multi-polar security arrangements. We must develop a realistic approach to China's economic growth. This includes using trade agreements to incentivize human rights improvements. India and Japan should become members of the G8. We should consider new multilateral trade talks to address financial, environmental, and human rights issues.Succumbing to nationalism and fear is easy. Overcoming such impulses is hard. Diplomacy does not just happen. We need to make it happen. And because the stakes are so high, we need to make it succeed. Nowhere are the stakes higher than in North Korea. I was there last week, at the invitation of the DPRK, and a bipartisan delegation headed by myself and former US Secretary of Veteran Affairs Anthony Principi. Our job was to bring the remains of six US servicemen home. We did our job and the remains of these honorable men, who gave their lives to defend our country, will soon be returned to their families. During our trip to North Korea, we also made progress on several issues related to the six-party talks and timeline for shutting down the Yongbyon reactor. We agreed to the following four points:  The DPRK reaffirmed their commitment to the Feb. 13th initial actions agreement.  The Treasury and Macao BDA announced the release of all DPRK funds.  The DPRK committed that within a day of receiving the funds will invite the IAEA to Pyongyang to draw up the terms for shutting down the reactor.  And finally, I impressed upon the DPRK the need to resume the six-party talksto finish the 60-day Initial Actions phase, and to draw up the final phase of disablement and declaration.Now, I've been critical in the past of the Bush Administration (and I will be critical again). But on this mission of National Security, politics stopped at the waters edge. I believe that by directly engaging with North Korea, we took a step toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. It's this type of tough talk and direct engagement that is the basis of my approach to American foreign policyan approach I call "New Realism" I believe we need a new realism for the 21st century that understands that diplomacy without power is weak, but power without diplomacy is blind. The paradox of America's power is that we cannot solve our problems without friends and allies. Terrorism, global warming and nuclear proliferation, for example, do not threaten just us -- they threaten everyone. And many dangers today come not from states targeting us with missiles, but rather our own consumption of fossil fuels. Not so much from hostile states as from hostile individuals and networks. In such a world, every nation's security has become tied to every other nation's security. Every nation's prosperity depends on the health of the global economy. And we all share the same fragile and stressed planet, whose ecological limits need to be respected. Not just the dangers, but also the opportunities of the 21st century, increasingly are global. For the first time in history, we have a chance to eliminate hunger and extreme poverty. Will we have the wisdom and the skill to harness this power? We also have the opportunity to combat the apocalyptic fantasies of Jihadists, by providing a billion Muslims with a positive vision of hope and jobs. We have the chance to construct an environmentally-sustainable post-carbon economy. And we have the possibility to integrate all of the great powers into a stable international order. America's moral authority has been damaged in recent years. We must restore our reputation as a nation which respects human rights and international law, and which values the opinions of others. Only by so doing can we recover the capacity for moral leadership which for decades served us so well. Building a safe and prosperous 21st century will require vision and hard work from established powers like the US and Japan, and from rising powers like China and India. For many years now, Chinese leaders and strategic analysts have stressed that China's rise as a global power will not threaten others. Others disagree, they believe that China's rise will threaten other Asian nations and perhaps even lead to a new Cold War between China and the US and its allies. We need to be realistic. There is a risk that China's rise will threaten its neighbors. There is the risk of a new Cold War. But this is NOT inevitable. I believe that the Chinese leadership is sincere in their desire to rise in a responsible, peaceful way. Their prosperity, after all, is based upon globalization and exports – and a belligerent foreign policy would place the very engine of their growth at risk. At the same time, China must end it's history of provocative statements and action on Taiwan that place the stability of the region at risk. We must do our part, and they must do theirs. China must also improve its human rights record and respect the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. In my experience as a diplomat, public scoldings do not work, but economic incentives often do.  Accordingly, we should negotiate firmly with the Chinese on human rights, and develop trade agreements should be used to incentivize human rights improvements.I would stress, however, that the single most important thing that America can do for human rights globally, is to be impeccable in our own behavior. We need to end Bush administration policies which are inconsistent with the Geneva conventions and international law. And we need to join the International Criminal Court. We should always encourage China to moderate in its relations with its neighbors. There are signs that China wishes to participate in a stable, peaceful Asia, and America should show its support. We should work with China, as Sudan's top trade partner, to end the genocide in Darfur and restabilize to WesternAfrica. And we should with all of East and South Asia to end the military occupation of Burma. Chinese military modernization, of course, makes everyone nervous. The best way for China to reassure its neighbors and the US, that it is not seeking hegemony over the region, is to be transparent about what it is doing, and to work with others to reassure them that its modernization is not aimed at them. To prevent the kind of spirals of distrust that lead to wars and Cold Wars, all parties need to be talking to one another and answering one another's questions. The United States can play a useful balancing role in Asia in the decades ahead, reassuring all parties that no single Asian power will become dominant. The U.S.-Japan alliance, which has been a cornerstone of U.S. security policy in Asia for six decades, serves not just Japan and the US, but also all of mainland Asia, as it assures others that the United States, not Japan, will play the key role in East Asian security. As Governor of New Mexico, I made it a priority to develop strong ties between my state and Japan. I believe the US-Japan alliance could provide a foundation for solving the world's energy crisis and show how we can promote stable relations in Asia. That's why, I invited the Japanese Government and several Japanese companies to work with New Mexico to establish a multi-disciplinary research facility in our state devoted to solar power. The US-India relationship presents both great opportunities and great risks. Handled properly, this relationship can help stabilize strategic relations on the Asian continent, deterring Islamist extremism and enabling India and China to manage a joint and peaceful rise to prosperity and power. But if we mismanage this friendship with the world's largest democracy, it could provoke a disastrous nuclear arms race in Asia. India can play a useful role by providing an economic counterbalance to China The US can help through our own even-handedness.  We should promote greater Asian representation in key global institutions. India and Japan should become permanent members of the UN Security Council and the G-8.In India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere, large Muslim populations mean that political relations will be affected for years to come by the war against Jihadism. East and South Asia Muslims have been less responsive to the Jihadists than have Arabs, Afghans and Pakistanis. An intelligent US foreign policy can help keep it that way. This means addressing the Palestinian problem, getting out of Iraq, and showing the world's Muslims – through our deeds as well as through our public diplomacy – that America is their friend.  America should spearhead a multilateral Marshall Plan for the Middle East and North Africa. We should invite Japan, China and other Asian countries to join us in this fight against poverty. For a small fraction of the cost of the Iraq war, which has made us so many enemies, we could make many friends. To those who say we cannot afford an aid program to build pro-American sentiment in the developing world, I say we cannot afford not to.But for trade agreements to be fair, environmentally-beneficial, and politically-sustainable, they need to take account of the huge gaps in levels of development around the world.  Trade accords must have enforceable mechanisms to insure respect for core ILO standards, including work conditions, minimum wages, occupational safety, child labor, the right to collective bargaining and the prohibition of compulsory and slave labor. Trade agreements also must incorporate environmental protections.  The United States should not enter into trade agreements with countries that do not sign the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.  The US also must join the Kyoto Protocol, negotiate a new global warming agreement that goes well beyond Kyoto, and make participation in it a condition of future trade agreements. The United States, like all countries, has the right to enforce trade agreements. This means using the WTO and U.S. trade remedy law to prod trading partners when they violate their commitments. With respect to China, the United States has the right to impose countervailing duties on subsidized exports, so long as we do it in a fair and reasonable manner and in accordance with our WTO commitments. Global multilateral trade talks have been the backbone of the world economy since WWII, under GATT and now WTO.  I hope that Doha can be revived, but if Doha fails, we need to do our best to promote freer trade, and we should consider bilateral and regional approaches in Asia -- so long as they do not undermine the prospects for global progress. I cannot overemphasize the importance of environmental sustainability. Asian growth will eventually come to a screeching halt if it is based upon fossil fuels, and other unsustainable technologies. Essential resources like water also cannot bear the brunt of rapid Asian growth using 20th century technologies. If China, India and the United States continue to increase coal-generated electricity without cleaner technology, they could produce as much as an extra 2.7 billions tons of CO2 by 2012. This would dwarf all the CO2 reductions called for by all signatories to the Kyoto Protocol. Such a catastrophe can be prevented if the United States takes the lead with other developed countries in advancing alternative technologies, and partnering with developing Asia to construct, rapidly, a sustainable development model.  If I were President, I would convene an Asia Energy summit with China, India, Japan, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the United Nations Environment Program, to adopt a ten-year strategy for a major energy transition in Asia. The stakes could not be higher. We must implement alternative technologies, on a global scale, as if our lives depended on it – because they do. The many economic, environmental and geo-strategic issues I have discussed today are, of course interrelated in complex ways. A world less dependent on fossil fuels, for example, would be less prone to conflicts over fossil fuels. A world with fewer carbon emissions would be a world less subject to terrible climactic events – such as flooding of low-lying countries like Bangladesh. A world of free and fair trade would be a world less prone to financial imbalances and to war and conflict. Perhaps most fundamentally, as nations work together to address and solve common problems, they develop the skills and the trust to address and solve other common problems. The United States has a key role to play in the coming years in forging the partnerships and reforming international institutions, so that China, India and other emerging states can be brought into a new concert of great powers which can address our shared problems. It is up to all of us to work together to achieve a stable, multi-polar Asia which can meet the great challenges of the 21st century. The alternative is unacceptable. The choice is ours. Acknowledgements  Thank you Jim Zogby for your kind introduction. I truly appreciate being here with the Arab American community to celebrate the Kahlil Gibran "Spirit of Humanity" Awards and I want to acknowledge Jim and George Salem for over twenty years of dedicated service to the political empowerment of the Arab American community. Your efforts are paying dividends as witnessed by the attendees this evening and by the fact that Arab Americans have become an integral part of America's body politic. I have been in Washington for just a few hours and have to catch an 8:00 flight. While my time with you will be brief this evening, rest assured that I look forward to future opportunities to meet with you. Tonight I would like to briefly share with you my vision of what the next President must be able to do. But tonight, we salute you. The awards that we celebrate today represent our common bond to humanity and I want to take a moment to congratulate tonight's very worthy recipients. Cardinal McCarrick is a man I hold in great esteem. He has dedicated his life to social justice here at home and peace beyond our borders. Global Impact is dedicated to helping the poorest people on earth, reaching 400 million in need. They are leading efforts to provide food, shelter, and clean water to refugees in Darfur, a crisis which I continue to work very hard to resolve. I also want to take a minute to congratulate the Arab American Institute for their commitment in working with the Save Darfur Coalition and I understand that an AAI advertisement will debut this evening that brings attention to the Darfur crises and seeks support in advocating for an immediate end to this human tragedy. AAI's commitment to ending suffering around the world reflects the common bond that we all share. We want to make this world more peaceful, more understanding and more livable for all people; so that everyone may fulfill their dreams and live in a world respectful of race, ethnicity, sex and religious tolerance. Congratulations AAI.  Finally, Search for Common Ground is an organization whose sole mission is to resolve conflict and as someone who has dedicated much of my career in public service to diplomacy and dialogue, I salute their efforts. Congratulations to all the award recipients and I think they deserve a heartfelt round of applause for their work. The American Dream  I'm proud to share this evening with the Arab American institute and your entire community. Like you, I understand first-hand the role that immigrants have played in building this great country. We are all here tonight as heirs to the American dream which was built by hard-working men and women. We all share stories of relatives who left their homes to come to America to build a better future. They are our mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers, and brothers and sisters. In fact, they are many of you here in this room. And those who came to this country came not just for economic opportunity, but for the freedom and civil rights provided by our Constitution. I know this because so many in your community sacrificed so much to come here that you, like most Americans hold these freedoms especially dear. For Arab Americans are at the forefront of the fight to protect the civil liberties of all Americans and in that fight you can always count on me as a friend and an ally. As a result of my career in public service, as a Congressman, Ambassador to the United Nations, Secretary of Energy and Governor of the great state of New Mexico, I see beyond our borders and I appreciate the leadership role America can play in the world. I have traveled throughout much of the Arab world, Asia, and Africa and tackled complex issues from North Korea's nuclear program to the ongoing tragedy in Darfur. In every instance I became more convinced that dialogue, not confrontation, is essential to solving conflict and crises and to restoring American leadership and credibility. Bringing People Together That's why I am running for President; because I believe I can bring people togethernationally and internationallyto address our toughest challenges. Internationally, our toughest challenge is restoring American credibility around the world. Our next President must show the world that the United States is ready to work with the world again. How do we do this? To restore our leadership we need to reject dogma and to embrace a New Realism for the 21st century. A realism that looks at the world through cool eyes, but that is also inspired by ardent principals. This is the path to renewed American leadership. I call this New Realism and it means among other things repairing alliances with our friends and negotiating with our enemies. Nelson Mandela once told me that "If you want a peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner." Talking with people is no guarantee of success, but refusing to talk is almost a guarantee of failure. As part of this effort, America should lead the world in spearheading a Middle East, North Africa, and Asian multi-national Marshall Plan that includes support for public education in the Muslim world which is the best way to mitigate the role of Salafist madrasas that foment extremism. We must help those Arabs and Muslims who promote a vision of peace, prosperity, tolerance and respect for human dignity, who form the overwhelming majority of the Arab and Muslim world, as opposed to the apocalyptic fantasies offered by a vocal minority of jihadists. America is a Belief John, your polls and those of others show time and again that the majority of Arabs and Muslims do not oppose American values – they embrace them. They oppose what they see as the inconsistency in applying them to our policies. We can fix that and here are a few ideas on how we can rectify the current situation. Here at home, we must adhere and protect the words, spirit and life of our Constitution for America is not just a country, it is a belief. A belief in a right to freedom of speech and freedom of religion. A belief that every man and woman has the right to elect their government and a belief in freedom, justice and equality. America is the land of opportunity, but we have much to do to ensure that America is the land of equality of opportunity. A land where Arab Americans are not judged by their ethnicity, a land where all citizens are afforded the protections of the constitution, a land where every child, whether they are majority, minority, Arab, Black, Jewish, Hispanic, Christian, Muslim, rich or poor can dare to dream and know that one day, their dreams can become reality. A land in which profiling, based on skin color, religion or your last name, is just a sad memory. A land that benefits from the diversity of our population, a land that recognizes the contributions that Arab Americans have made and continue to make to our nation on equal footing as all Americans. A land that guarantees the constitutional protection of equal justice under the law and a land that does not question ones patriotism as a result of their race, ethnicity, creed, color, sex, religion or economic status. This is the America I love, this is the America others envy, this is the America that I believe in and this is the America that can be restored. Conclusion In closing, I want you to know, that my door is always open to you and that I welcome your advice and views. The American system is founded on being able to air your grievances- the government does not always listen- but we must never stop challenging the abuses we live with everyday. I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face as a nation and with your faith and vision we will keep our moral compass pointing in the right direction. I know that we may not always agree on the issues, but I want you to know that when we disagree, I will not be disagreeable. I will listen to your concerns, consider your requests, and my ears are and will continue to bend towards your voices. I will not disappoint you. Thank you and congratulations on your awards banquet, and I looking forward to watching this ad. Take comfort in knowing that while my visit is short this evening, that I look forward to working with you and towards making a difference in America, in the world and for the all children. I want to take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge all the hard working union members that are here with us today. Today -- American workers are more productive than ever. But their real wages are shrinking---their pensions are threatenedand their health-care coverage is cut. Meanwhile this administration cuts student loans, hands out tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and wants to privatize social security. America's workers are the backbone of our country and I am proud to stand with you here today  and I want to thank you for standing with me throughout my career. The men and women of the Labor movement are a primary reason why I have been able to accomplish so much in New Mexico.  Creating more than 84,000 jobs in the last four years. Cutting one billion in taxesnot for the wealthybut for working families And expanding access to health insurance to working families, and today every child five years or younger has access to health care coverage.Their support helped me and the Democrats recapture state government after eight years of Republican rule. And it is only with the help of the hardworking men and women of Labor that Democrats will recapture the White House. It's through that same hard work that the people of New Hampshire have a new minimum wage---a wage with dignity. After three years working side-by-side with labor, we've been able to do the same in New Mexico. But I think we all know--raising the minimum wage is the best way to stand up for the working poor. But, we need to stand up for the middle class too. And the best way we can do that is by supporting unions. Raising state minimum wages is good, but not good enough. Raising the federal minimum wage is good, but not good enough. To renew America's middle class, we shouldn't stop until every worker's wage is a union wage. And that starts with majority authorization. That doesn't just mean giving employees a chance to form unions by signing cards authorizing union representation. That also means swiftly punishing those employers who violate any worker's right to organize. I believe the members organizations of AFL-CIO don't have to ask where I stand--  As one of my first acts as Governor, I stood with the AFSCME, CWA, AFT and restored collective bargaining rights for public employees---with card-check recognition and fair share. There are no free riders in my stateperiod. I stood with the American Federation of Teachersand together we created new standards, linked them to higher teacher salaries, and our teacher salaries have moved from 46th to 29th in the nation – and our teacher quality has jumped from 30th to 17th.  I stood with CWA and together we a statewide project called Wire New Mexico to create a high-speech, high capacity data, voice and video communications backbone. That network will be installed, maintained and upgraded by union workers. I stood with the theatrical and stage employees union to invest state funds to train new technicians to work on more than $1 billion dollars in film and television production over the last four years. That union has grown from 60 registered members to over 1400 and those productions are proudly stamped Made in the USA with a Union label.  I stood with the New Mexico Building and Trades. When we financed the $400 million construction for a new state hospital, we negotiated the first Public Works Project Labor Agreement in New Mexico history. That 100% union project is on-time and on-budget. And in my state, I made the prevailing wage a union wage. I also worked with the Building and Trades Department to create the toughest independent contractor law in the country. In New Mexico, we require independent contractors to be licensed as a business, have a written contract and control the work. Break the lawand you'll face a fine or spend some time in jail--a 100% union-built jail.  And I stood with workers when I was President Clinton's Secretary of Energy. When I started, there was a disturbing number of staff, craftsmen, and many of your members who were sick or dyingI call them the "silent cold warriors." These brave men and women had served for decades supporting the critical research and tests to guarantee America's nuclear defense. But, everyone was focused on what went into the air and water, not what was going into the bodies of our workers.  First, I did what should have been done long agoI apologized for the federal government's failure to protect these workers.  Second, I worked with Congress and President Clinton to put together a nuclear worker compensation package--$150,000 dollars per worker and payment of all medical expenses.  I'm proud to say, to-date, it has dispensed more than $2 billion to workers or their survivorstrying to right a terrible wrong. (In New Mexico, labor sits at the head of the table). No I sit at the head of the table but we have union representatives on every commission affecting your membership, in my cabinet, all the way up to deputy chief of staff and former head of the New Mexico Building Trades, Brian Condit. Over the years, unions and I have seen eye-to-eye a lot. As Governor I've been proud to receive the endorsement of every state labor union, the support of labor as Secretary of Energy, and in my 15 years in Congress I received an 88% rating from the AFL-CIO. (And for the 12% who disagreed with me, I also have been endorsed by the NRA, and they would like to have a word with you. Just kidding) I want to underscore an important point.  In 1992 Unions households turned out 19% of the votethe entire national voteand Governor Clinton became the first Democratic president in a dozen years.  In 2000 Unions turned out 25% of the voteand Al Gore won. In 2006 Unions turned out in force and today, we have a Democratic Congress. You've always done your part in helping Democrats. (Heck, you do more than your part). It's now time Democrat's did ours. Labor has a seat at my Cabinet table and a voice in my administration in New Mexico. When I'm President, my Secretary of Labor will be from the ranks of organized labor. You will sit at my Cabinet table and you will be the voice of labor--in my Administration. Second, Democrats need to work to create new jobs---clean energy jobs. Let me tell you about those 84-thousand new jobs in New Mexico. We're building biodiesel and ethanol plants, electric automotive and solar manufacturing sites, and providing new incentives to construct clean coal plants. We're reducing our dependence on foreign oil, beating global warming and creating thousands of high-wage jobs. We've become the clean energy state. I want to make us the clean energy nation, and be America's first "Energy President." Now, another President---Bill Clinton used to send me in to negotiate the freedom of American hostages and political prisoners. He'd say "Send Richardson, bad guys seem to like him." And that's how I ended up negotiating face-to-face with people like Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, and the North Koreans. And every time, I brought Americans home. I think we need the same sort of strong and focused diplomacy, with friends and foes alike, in order to adapt our foreign policy to the global nature of energythe global catastrophe of global warmingand the disaster in Iraq. We have to undo the damageand the world is waiting. But, if this president's foreign policy inexperience got us into this war, then it's going to take someone with real hands-on international experience to lead us out. In the next nine months, I hope you will ask each candidate lot of questions. Listen to what promises we make, but ask us what promises we've kept. Listen to how we will unify our party, but ask us how we can unify the country. Listen to how we will withdrawal from Iraq, but ask us how we will negotiate the peace. Choose a candidate who's got the vision and experienceto win the presidency, to unify our country, and to renew our leadership in the world. I believe I offer that vision and experience. I ask you to join me. Let's end the division and bring our country together. Let's start fighting for things that matteraccess to health care, quality education, better jobs, and creating a clean energy economy. Let's rebuild America's middle class by supporting every workers right to organize. And because stubbornness isn't a foreign policy---Let's never be afraid to talk with our foes. And let's have the courage to end this war in Iraq and renew America's diplomacy and reputation in the world. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you, Ted, for that introduction. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here today at the New America Foundation. I appreciate your sensible policy influence in many areas. Thanks to my friend Terry Tamminen, head chef in my friend Arnold Schwarzenegger's kitchen cabinet. Thanks also to Diana Farrell and the McKinsey Global Institute for their excellent report on energy productivity, to be released today. It confirms what we have been doing in New Mexico and the West, and it supports what I will discuss today. Energy productivity is critical to meeting energy demand. It creates a more resilient, more prosperous economy. And for consumers, it saves money, saves energy, and protects the climate. The McKinsey report is a huge step forward in understanding energy. I want to recognize some of the other folks here as well. Steve Howard, from the Climate Group, bringing the private sector together to face some of the world's biggest challenges. Bill Prindle from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, who's a great resource on energy efficiency. Linda Fisher, from DuPont, a company that is leading the corporate sector on sustainability. John Stowell, from Duke Energy, among the nation's leaders in seeking clean energy solutions. I am sure I missed people I should acknowledge, but I don't have a lot of time. So let me get started. Jefferson said something like "a little revolution every twenty years isn't a bad thing." We have known about this country's energy problems for 35 years, yet our energy revolution stopped in about 1985, when we rolled back fuel economy standards. Since then our consumption has climbed, fuel efficiency has stagnated, and our crippling dependence on foreign oil has about doubled. Today, I am going to stake my claim to being the next president, the Energy President, on the concept of a fast, comprehensive energy revolution in the United States. Gasoline is back up over $3 a gallon. People are hurting. The decline in retail sales reported for April was among the worst ever, partly because most American households do not have income to spread across high gasoline costs and all the other expenses of life. These gasoline price increases have virtually nothing to do with the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or the Outer Continental Shelf. They are not because oil is running out, or because of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. I am here to tell you consumers are hurting because U.S. energy markets are not diverse and competitive, and because we have fed our addiction to oil instead of ending it. We are bleeding ourselves to death, buying up to 300 billion dollars worth of foreign oil every year, and spending another 100 or 150 billion dollars transporting and defending oil around the world. The potential for larger price spikes and pain is even scarier. A successful terrorist attack on critical oil infrastructure, for instance, could drive prices up to $100 or $120 or even $150 a barrel. We need a bold, aggressive national energy and climate policy that helps Americans who are struggling to heat their homes and fill their gas tanks, and that moves us to safe, available alternatives as quickly as possible. That policy will recognize and benefit from the regional differences that give the United States its strength and diversity. These regional strengths – from the wind and solar of my own Mountain region, to the biomass and coal of the Midwest, to the tidal forces on the coasts – will help the United States meet the two great challenges of our era: energy security and global warming. Here are the principles that guide my thinking. Our energy policy solutions must fight global warming, which threatens human, ecological, and economic catastrophe literally everywhere on earth. Our energy policy solutions must wean us from oil, because any oil addiction perverts our nation's strategic objectives, limits our options, and costs us both blood and treasure. Next, in meeting this challenge, we must support and help people, communities, industries, and small businesses who could be hurt by a careless transition – but are being terribly hurt by soaring prices today. Further, I am a market-oriented Democrat. I want to set clear regulatory standards and systems and incentives, and allow the markets to respond. Finally, we must keep the U.S. at the forefront of science and technology development – exploring frontiers, finding solutions to our energy and climate challenges. These are my bedrock principles -- they are not subject to negotiation. We need a man-on-the-moon program to end this addiction, this hemorrhage. But we need it much faster and much more boldly than people are suggesting. When John F. Kennedy challenged this country to reach the moon, he challenged us to get there in TEN years, not twenty, or thirty, or forty. On energy policy, we need to change fast, or sink slowly. I am issuing a call to action, for Congress, the energy industry, and the public. I am calling for a new American revolution – an energy and climate revolution. People in politics and industry might say it can't be done. My goals are too lofty. I am not comparing myself to JFK, but I know that when he challenged Americans to reach the moon in 10 years, America responded by saying, "How can we help?" We didn't say, "It can't be done." I bring experience and a record of accomplishment to this challenge. As Governor of New Mexico, I have put renewable energy requirements in place, supported generous solar tax incentives, eliminated sales taxes on hybrid vehicles, set aggressive targets to reduce global warming pollution – a list of about 40 important initiatives. New Mexico is now the Clean Energy State. As Energy Secretary, even with very low oil prices, I pushed for aggressive energy efficiency standards, conservation in the midst of the California electricity crisis, a national renewable portfolio standard, and development of new vehicle technology. As a diplomat and negotiator, I have a record of dealing successfully with hostage-takers and tyrants. Now I want to bring that experience to the task of freeing the United States from its status as international hostage to costly energy, and from the tyranny of oil dependence. I have a record, I have the will, and I am making this the central priority for new national policy in my campaign for president. When I take office, the Congress and I will have a second "First 100 Days," like FDR's, to focus on changing energy and climate policy right away. Here is my five-goal policy framework to break our oil addiction, create competition and value for consumers, strengthen our national security, create American jobs, and lead the world to effective climate protection. It starts with goal 1, a dramatic reduction in oil consumption by 2020. The United States consumes about 21 million barrels of oil per day. After Katrina, about 65% of this was imported. By 2020, with hard work and the cooperation of Congress and the American people, we will reduce our oil dependence by at least 6 million barrels a day, probably 8 million, and possibly as much as 10 million. First, we need to get low- and zero-petroleum plug-in cars into the marketplace, while sharply reducing the carbon emissions from our electric sector. This is the most important single step we can take in changing our oil consumption patterns for the future. By 2020, this change will reduce consumption by around 2 million barrels a day, with far larger reductions in the years after that. As Energy Secretary, I supported the electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle concepts. They work. The battery technologies have come a long way. I am talking about two types of vehicles. The pure-electric vehicle offers simplicity and performance for an average daily commute in our larger metro areas, like the big cities on the coasts and in the midwest. The plug-in electric car or truck provides more range and flexibility for people who might drive longer distances, and it can extend gas mileage above 100 miles per gallon. Plug-in cars don't need a whole new refining and retailing infrastructure, like hydrogen, which has potential for the more distant future. The infrastructure is there, in your wall sockets. Most consumers will love the plug-in car. As a consumer, you choose your fuel. Gasoline at 3, maybe 4 dollars a gallon? Or electricity, costing a dollar or two for a 100-mile charge? In February of 2009, within 30 days of taking office, I will hold a two-day White House plug-in summit with automakers, utilities, and labor. We will lock in the program to get the 100 mile per gallon car on the market across the board, and to make sure we are building clean electricity to fuel it. I will push this plug-in car concept with significant rebates to consumers who buy them, and by supporting automakers who want to build them. I expect the Big Three automakers to lead the world in this technology. There are other manufacturers – including an electric car manufacturing company in my own state – who are fast getting into the market, at Detroit's peril. Here's my second oil-saving initiative. I will push fuel economy standards to 50 miles per gallon by 2020. As a result, our conventionally powered automotive fleet will reduce its demand by as much 3 million barrels a day. What the Congress is considering right now, at thirty-five miles per gallon, marks progress after years of inaction – but we made better progress 30 years ago. In fact, between 1977 and 1985, the U.S. reduced oil demand by 17% without any of the great new technologies and alternatives we have available now. As the McKinsey report says, aligning U.S. fuel economy standards to international levels could save millions of barrels of oil every day. And it will save money for people who use conventionally fueled vehicles – perhaps as much as $1,000 or $2,000 a year for people who drive long distances, as we do out West. Automakers, including Detroit, can meet these standards by using lighter but safer materials and new engine efficiencies such as ultra-clean diesels. Here's my third oil-saving initiative. We will create a well-to-wheels low-carbon fuel requirement that reduces the carbon impact of our liquid fuels by 30% by 2020, including alternative fuels that will substitute for about 10% of our gasoline demand. This standard will bring our oil consumption down by another 2 million barrels a day. These fuels can be produced all over the country, creating jobs in rural areas, and preventing the export of petrodollars to other nations. Fourth, we will reduce oil consumption by non-auto transportation – ships, trains, trucks, and planes. This will include new technologies, including some fuel-switching to electricity and renewable fuels – and save another 500,000 barrels a day. We will work to increase the efficiency in non-transportation sectors as well, potentially saving another 500,000 barrels per day. And I will support smart growth and public transportation policies that will reduce driving and save oil. This is an integrated, comprehensive approach to a tremendous national challenge. It relies on American technology, patriotism, and cooperation. In all, by 2020, with real presidential leadership and the support of Congress and the American people, we will sharply reduce oil demand by six, eight or even 10 million barrels a day. Goal number two is new efficiencies and energy sources in the electrical sector. I will call for a national renewable portfolio standard of 30% by 2020, rising to 50% by 2040. As you know, a renewable portfolio standard, or RPS, requires a certain amount of renewable energy to be represented in the electricity sold to every consumer. I know this is extremely aggressive. But with retirements of older, inefficient power plants, a new carbon cap and trade system, and growing demand for electricity from plug-in cars, we must capitalize on the low-carbon energy sources nature provides for us – wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.When I was chair of the Western Governors' Association, I worked closely with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to build bipartisan support for 30,000 megawatts of new renewables in the West by 2015. We found that this amount – and even more – would be cost-effective and achievable. Further, based on research like the McKinsey report today, I will push for a law requiring a 20% improvement in energy productivity by 2020. When the Western Governors' Association studied my proposal to achieve this 20 by 20 goal, it found that we could easily achieve those savings – at a 2.5 to 1 cost-benefit ratio, saving western customers $21 billion a year by 2020. Goal three is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 20% by 2020, and 80% by 2040. New scientific evidence shows that we must move faster than we thought to address climate change and global warming. We must show other nations that we will cooperate with them to hold atmospheric carbon dioxide levels under a safe, acceptable level. We will start with a market-based cap and trade system. By 2020, utilities and industry will be allowed to emit 80% as much global warming pollution as they do today, and they will have to buy rights to do so, creating a real market for pollution reduction. It's like musical chairs for carbon. By 2050 there will be 90% fewer chairs. When these savings are combined with savings in the transportation sector, I believe we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions overall by 30% or more by 2020. My program allows time for businesses and utilities to prepare and adjust, and provides time for the federal government to develop a regime for safe, long-term carbon disposal, or sequestration. I believe that coal – carbon-clean coal – will play a role in our energy future, and that we must support the deployment of carbon-clean coal technologies here and around the world. We can afford to protect the climate. Given the risks of catastrophic climate change, we must afford it. A small commitment could save incalculable amounts in preventing drought and natural disasters, famine and disease, and destruction of coastal areas and oceans. My fourth goal is to capitalize on our strengths in science and technology. America is the engine room of global innovation and ingenuity. Whenever I meet our college and university students and faculty, I see vital new enthusiasm and commitment to meeting these energy and climate challenges. It's inspiring – but it is also a valuable resource. We have strong educational and research institutions. We have the world's best-trained intellectual and academic base. Scientists and technologists from around the world want to study and work here. That is a huge strength, one that we must not waste, and one that can nourish our growth and leadership in meeting the energy and climate challenge. I don't generally agree with the concept of collecting large sums of federal revenue and putting them into vast funds, holding ten or fifty billion dollars a year, that the government would use to pick winners and losers in energy technology. But I do think the federal government must play a critical role in supporting and pushing new technologies, in collaboration with scientists and investors and companies. I believe we can create a national energy innovation trust fund with a one-time funding commitment, a fund that should provide needed research and technology support and that will sustain itself over time by helping the private sector deploy the best energy technologies. It is here, in science and technology, that we have the most potential to surprise ourselves with large gains reducing oil consumption and global warming emissions. We must invest in our world-leading institutions and programs in science and technology. My fifth goal is to lead by example, making the United States a beacon of the new energy future. We have become a lone wolf instead of the brave eagle, at least in the eyes of the world. It is time for us to fly high again, to see the whole landscape, to be seen by the world, to represent freedom, and human rights. As we implement these far-reaching policy changes at home, we must immediately return to the international negotiating table and support mandatory limits on global warming pollution, keeping atmospheric carbon below 450 parts per million. Nations such as India and China are waiting to implement big changes in their energy policies because the United States hasn't committed yet. Yet they know climate protection is in everyone's interest, including their own. My international program will include working closely and bilaterally with fast-growing nations like China, Brazil, South Africa, and India so that they use new, low-carbon technologies to meet their fast-growing demand. To achieve this, I will cooperate with the European Union, the World Bank, the Asian partnership, agencies of the United Nations, and our allies around the world to help finance the small incremental cost of "doing it right." Internationally speaking, we must also groom relations with our largest oil suppliers, Mexico and Canada, which supply about 20% of our oil. My North American Energy Council will stabilize the oil and gas trade, work on a continental electrical grid, help bring energy resources and productivity to market throughout the continent, and develop a regional system for carbon trading. I know the importance of Arctic natural gas – from Canada and Alaska – and want to help bring that relatively non-polluting, plentiful, reliable resource to market. I also know Mexico, and believe that we can have a strong, constructive, historic relationship with that country that strengthens its economy and reduces immigration tensions. Lastly, we should work with the Gulf nations, and our partners in consuming nations and the United Nations Security Council, to try to create a multilateral system for protecting the Gulf. Securing the Gulf and other oil transportation routes, multilaterally, could help stabilize oil prices and international peace. About the oil companies... I know people love to hate the oil companies. They have been raking in huge profits. But I want to invite them to become energy companies, and invest in our thriving new energy future. The energy industry is invited to the table, but it isn't going to run the table the way it has in the last five years. In closing Americans need heat and electricity in our homes, schools and workplaces. We need to get places. Americans are hurt by unpredictable and soaring energy prices. The way out is to get off oil, to create competition, to support energy productivity, to maximize our strengths in science and research, and invest in new technologies and energy sources. We can create a new energy future, with broad, bold strokes. And we must sharply reduce our global warming pollution in the process. A brief, conceptual speech doesn't provide all the details. I know. So I hope you will go to my website and look at my new white paper on energy, security and climate. This is the way to a bright, strong, prosperous future for the United States – and for the world. I called for an energy revolution – and now, today, I call on you to join it. Thanks for your time. RUSSERT: Governor Richardson, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.RICHARDSON: Nice to be with you, Tim.RUSSERT: As you well know, the Democratic leadership in Congress had been trying to have a withdrawal date for all troops from Iraq tied to the bill which provided funding for the troops. They then agreed to take away that withdrawal language and pass the money without it present in the bill. Should the Democratic leadership have done that?RICHARDSON: No. I believe the Democrats in Congress missed a great opportunity. What is not working, Tim–because the American people want us to get out of Iraq, and we must because it's hurting our national interest. What the Democrats have been doing in my judgment is focusing on the wrong initiative, and that is more funding cuts, more timetables. What I would propose is a deauthorization resolution, under the War Powers Act, Article I, that basically allows the Congress to determine whether we're at war at not. And what has happened now is, I believe, is that the first resolution that was voted on several years ago is not operative anymore. Sadaam Hussein is out, there are no weapons of mass destruction, the American people are totally against this war. I believe a deauthorizing resolution would pass. Under Article I, the president wouldn't veto it. But I do believe that the Congress missed, missed a–missed an opportunity. We must get out of Iraq. The American people, everywhere I go, not just in the early primary states, want an exit strategy. They want to see a policy where our troops are safe. They want us to regain our international stature. And the key is a withdrawal from Iraq.RUSSERT: You would have voted against a bill that did not have a fixed withdrawal date.RICHARDSON: Yes.RUSSERT: On your Web site you say this: "Troops out in" '07. "We should get our troops out of Iraq this year. No residual forces left behind. We must remove all of our troops. There should be no residual U.S. forces left in Iraq." Now, I want to compare that to what you said in your book, "Between Worlds," which just came out about 18 months ago. You write this: "At this point ... we must see this mission through. We mustn't stay in Iraq past the point where the new government asks us to leave, but neither can we unilaterally pull out before the Iraqis have achieved control over their own internal security. We owe them the opportunity to make their democracy work. We must not undermine their efforts now." That's exactly what you're doing, undermining their efforts.RICHARDSON: Tim, I know this region well. I was U.N. ambassador. Eighty percent of my time was spent on the Iraq issue. I faced down Saddam Hussein, brought back two American hostages. I know the region well. I know the leaders there. I regret not having pushed more diplomatically early on with President Bush. I do regret that. But look where we are now. There's a civil war, there's sectarian conflict. Right now I believe we must withdraw all our troops by the end of this calendar year with no residual forces because our troops today are a target. We are viewed...RUSSERT: So, but then–though–to be sure–that's totally contrary to what you wrote in your book. So you're now, in effect, saying what you wrote in the book is no longer operative.RICHARDSON: No, Tim, like everybody else, when we went into Iraq, I wanted to support the troops. But after incompetency, deceitfulness by this administration, the fact that there's no weapons of mass destruction, the link to al-Qaeda was enormously suspect, what we now have is 61 percent of the Iraqi people feel it's OK to shoot an American soldier, 71 percent Sunni, Shia want us out of Iraq. We–there is no basis for us to be there. What we need to do is disengage our troops but set up a diplomatic effort, three-pronged: One, a reconciliation of all the three religious and ethnic groups in Iraq–the Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds–for a division of power, coalition government, divide up oil revenues, a date and type separation of three entities, an all-Muslim peacekeeping force that I believe could provide security for Iraq, along with the Iraqis, and then a donor conference to deal with reconstruction.Our troops have done a magnificent job, but now they have become targets. Now it's up to the Iraqis to take over. And you know, Tim, the Iraqis are not necessarily today helpless. They have 300,000 security forces, they have $150 billion in oil reserves, they've had three elections, so they have, they have a constitution, they have democratic institutions. It is time for them to take over.RUSSERT: But there's only 6,000 Iraqi troops that can stand alone and operate independently of U.S. forces.RICHARDSON: Yeah, but there's 300 other security forces that, that are–this was–this came out of the Department of Defense, May the 6th, that there's over 330,000 security forces that are being trained. One of the problems, Tim, is the Maliki government is not stepping up to the plate in two key areas: one, national reconciliation between the Sunni and the Shia; and then secondly, in terms of training their own troops, they're slow, there's bureaucracy. Perhaps they don't have the political will.I believe that our obsession with Iraq, Tim, has cost us enormously. Not just prestige around the world, but also in focusing on the major threats of this country, which are international terrorism, nuclear terrorism, building an international coalition, nuclear proliferation, a loose nuclear weapon in the hand of rogue nations, global climate change. So many other priorities. Darfur, issues relating to poverty, AIDS, refugees, the status of women around the world, sexual slavery, rape. There's so many other priorities that we're not focusing on because we have an obsession with Iraq.RUSSERT: Governor, your proposal of an immediate troop withdrawal this year is not being supported by anyone of consequence. Can you name one military expert who says that's the way to go?RICHARDSON: Well, I have a military adviser, very distinguished general, Robert Gard, former head of the National Defense University, decorated soldier. I have many other advisers that believe that this is the–Philip Coyle, assistant secretary of Weapons and Evaluation, who was on the BRAC Commission. Tim, a lot of experts...RUSSERT: And they say withdraw troops this year?RICHARDSON: They support my plan.RUSSERT: No residual force?RICHARDSON: They, they support my plan. And, Tim, you know, a lot of these experts that, that, that are all over the Beltway are the ones that got us into this mess. I know the region, I've been to Iraq. I, I know the leaders in the region. I believe what is needed is a regional approach that also deals with the Israeli-Palestinian issue, that also deals with talking to Iran and Syria as part of a solution, of very tough negotiations with those two countries.RUSSERT: The New York Times today, front page lead story, talked to 40 Iraqi politicians, citizens, consulted other experts in the field, and not a one believes that an immediate withdrawal is viable. General Anthony Zinni, former head of U.S. Central Command, who opposed the war, said it's going to take five to seven years for that area to stabilize. Do you really believe that an immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops would not lead to complete chaos in Iraq and the region?RICHARDSON: There is chaos now. There's civil war, there's sectarian conflict. Look at the...RUSSERT: And it wouldn't worse–it wouldn't worsen...RICHARDSON: Look, look at the...RUSSERT: If U.S. troops left, would it worsen?RICHARDSON: No. Because our troops are the targets. And, Tim, you cannot start reconciliation, you cannot start unifying the region and protecting our interests until everyone believes that the American military presence is, is going to go. Now, you know, I–I'm for securing our embassy, obviously, with, with Marine personnel. But I do believe, Tim, that what is critically important now is a diplomatic effort, a regional effort. It's called talking to your enemies. Like Yitzhak Rabin said, you don't make peace with your friends, you make peace with your enemies. It means talking to Iran, it means talking to Syria, getting an all-Muslim peacekeeping force–Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia–to be part of an all-Muslim effort that secures Iraq. And then the Iraqis have to step up and do it.RUSSERT: If Iraq completely destabilized, if you withdraw–withdrew troops, would you be willing to consider sending troops back in to stabilize it?RICHARDSON: What I would do, Tim, is I would have troops where they're wanted, in Kuwait. We have bases there, in Bahrain. I would have a contingency in case of an international terrorist attack. I mean, al-Qaeda is our enemy. Our involvement in Iraq has led us to fail to focus on the true threat, al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, in the region. Nuclear proliferation, a loose piece of plutonium or uranium that is transported into some of our, some of our cities. The fact that we don't have a viable homeland security policy in this country to protect our ports, our aircraft.RUSSERT: But again, again, if the situation in Iraq deteriorated and further destabilized, all-out civil war spilling over into surrounding countries, would you consider sending troops back in to stabilize?RICHARDSON: You, you know, a president would never preclude a military option. But I would be ready to provide the Iraqis with air power, special forces protection. There would be troops in the region that, that, that would be available for any contigency. But the problem now, Tim, is our presence has caused what I believe is a civil war, a sectarian conflict. And the best policy right now that protects our interest is for us to disengage. And I would do it by the end of this calendar year. Let the military decide that. But if you leave residual troops–and that is the difference between my position and all the other candidates, that our residual troops–what is it, 20,000 out of the 130,000 that are there? That is a significant portion. The Iraqis should be in charge of security and protecting our embassy and our personnel that stay there.RUSSERT: So you regret supporting the war initially?RICHARDSON: Yes, I do. It was a mistake. But I was pushing intensively, at the time, for more diplomatic engagement, to go to the United Nations, to bring international support for our goals, to go to NATO, to, to get strong Security Council resolutions. I didn't push hard enough. I didn't push hard enough. But, you know, I, I didn't have the intelligence everybody else had. Incompetence, deceitfulness...RUSSERT: But you said you knew more about the region than anybody else.RICHARDSON: Well, yeah.RUSSERT: So it was a mistake?RICHARDSON: Yes, it was a mistake. It was a mistake. I, I openly state that.RUSSERT: Let me ask you about a controversy that has arisen from some speech you've been giving on the stump, particularly in New Hampshire, regarding a mother from New Mexico. Here's the headline from the Associated Press: "Mother of fallen Marine says Richardson misrepresented conversation with her.""On the campaign trail, presidential hopeful Bill Richardson tells a moving story about a New Mexico Marine killed in Iraq and his mom. But is it true?"Three years ago, Richardson attended a memorial service for Lance Corporal Aaron Austin, 21, who died in April" of "2004. As he campaigns for the Democratic nomination, the New Mexico governor often recounts an emotional conversation with Austin's mother, saying she thanked him for the federal death benefits she had received and even showed him the government check."In speeches in New Hampshire, Richardson has gotten Austin's name wrong at least once," "age wrong at least twice. He also has called Austin the first New Mexico soldier killed in Iraq–instead of the third."But that's not what bothers the Marine's mother, De'on Miller, of Lovington, New Mexico, who says the conversation about money never took place. 'I don't know a person rich or poor that would be told that" her "only living child has been killed, and you're going to strike up a money conversation? Bill Richardson needs to stop pushing this lie. Aaron's name had better not be used again in any way. Not mine either. A full written apology is due me for this.'" Will you apologize to her?RICHARDSON: Tim, she–we have different recollections. That family is heroic, that young man is heroic. But let me tell you what that–my attending that ceremony caused. It inspired me to go to the New Mexico legislature and propose a $250,000 death benefit–life insurance–for every National Guardsman in New Mexico. It's now $400,000. It passed. I made it happen. And then 30 other states–I went to the National Governors Association, and we pushed this--30 other states have made this happen. And the federal death benefit has gone up.Now, I, I fully respect that family. We have different recollections. But that's where I learned, at that ceremony, that the death benefit for our soldiers was $11,000. And look, Tim, I am not going to–there is nobody that has done more for veterans, any governor, I believe, than I have. No state income tax for enlisted people. I was just in North Korea two months ago, and I brought back–I've been working on this for years–the remains of six Americans from the Korean War. All kinds of initiatives, such as this life insurance policy that has been...RUSSERT: But if it troubles her, out of respect for Mrs. Miller and her son Aaron Austin, will you stop using his name and her name?RICHARDSON: Yes, I will. I will do that. But we just have different recollections, Tim, and–but, but that family is honorable. I attended that service. I was really moved. You know, I call as many of the mothers of New Mexico soldiers that've been killed. But no one will ever question my commitment to help our veterans. I was in North Korea. I rescued–I helped rescue, helped push forward the release of–many years ago–of, of an American helicopter pilot. So I believe very strongly that we have to stand up for our veterans when they come back, coming back PTSD, they're not getting the help that they deserve.RUSSERT: But if Mrs. Miller feels used, you would apologize for it.RICHARDSON: Well, Tim, I–that's where I learned about this death benefit. There was an individual there that saw a piece of paper being given to me. I, I don't want to get into this. I want this to–I respect that woman. I will not mention it again.RUSSERT: And you're sorry?RICHARDSON: Well, I'm sorry for the way she feels, but I believe I acted honorably. Look at the result. The result was $400,000 life insurance for New Mexico National Guardsmen that served and then 30 states that covered all their veterans. They followed New Mexico's lead. They followed my lead. The federal death benefit, which was shameful, $11,000, $12,000 is now significantly higher.RUSSERT: Let me turn to immigration. Last week this is what all the newspapers said. "The Senate's compromise immigration bill is forcing the presidential candidates to confront a divisive issue. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson praised the bill. 'This legislation makes a good start" towards "re-securing our Southern border.'" A few days later this headline appeared. "Hispanic presidential hopeful confronts immigration debate. On Wednesday Richardson said that after ready the immigration bill in detail, he decided to oppose it, saying the measure placed too great a burden on immigrants, tearing apart families that wanted to settle in the U.S., creating a permanent tier of second-class immigrant workers and financing a border fence. This is fundamentally flawed in its current form and I would oppose it. We need bipartisanship, we also need legislation that's compassionate. I'm not sure this is it.'" How can you be for it and 72 hours later against it?RICHARDSON: Well, no, this is what happened. I was announcing for president, and the day before, I saw a summary of a bill that had been proposed in the Senate. And the summary, I believed, contained essential elements of a comprehensive immigration reform bill. One, that there be tougher border security, doubling of border patrol agents. That's good. And two, a legalization program for the 12 million that are here. Three, it also contained penalties for employers that knowingly hired illegal workers. I thought that was all good. The bill is then presented, and I read it the next day, and it contained some problems. Now, I praise the Congress and the president for, in a bipartisan way, putting something forward that is a good start. But the problem, Tim–look, I deal with this issue every day. I'm a border governor. Two years ago, I declared a border emergency in New Mexico because the flow of people and drugs were harming New Mexico. So I have strong qualifications on this issue. I've been dealing it–with it for years. The problem with the immigration bill, the way I read it now, Tim, is one, it separates families. It gives–it gives too much credence to job skills rather than families. The essence of all our immigration laws have been to preserve families, and this separates families. Secondly, a guest worker program. The guest worker program, first posting, should be to protect American workers to have the, the top job, to, to have the jobs and not the guest workers. There are no labor protections for those guest workers. And then third, what I also saw in the bill that was not reported in the summaries is that it's good to have more border guards, and we have to double them, and there's been a problem because the federal government has not trained enough to make that happen. But the fence, the fence, the wall between Mexico and the United States, there's more funding for it. This wall is wrong. This wall is a terrible symbol between two countries that are friends. And you're going to have a 10-foot wall, and what's going to happen is there's going to be 11-foot ladders going over that wall construct...RUSSERT: The wall hasn't worked?RICHARDSON: No, it hasn't worked.RUSSERT: Anywhere along the border, the fence hasn't worked.RICHARDSON: It hasn't worked. What has worked is more border patrols. What has worked is some National Guardsmen. What has worked is some technology. It's made the program better. But, Tim, we got to talk to Mexico, our friend, get them to do more. In fact, get them to stop giving max–maps to illegal workers on the most porous areas to court. And we also need to raise the legal immigration limits, the backlogs of workers that we need–Europeans, others that–Indians, H1B visas for job competitiveness skills.RUSSERT: I'm going to ask you in a second about a comment made by Brian Sanderoff who analyzes public opinion in, in New Mexico. But listening to you, you declared a border emergency, and yet you're against the fence. You were for illegal immigrants obtaining driver's licenses, and you were for legislation that would permit illegal immigrants' children to get college scholarships. It seems as, as if you're on both sides of the issue. This is what Brian Sanderoff said: "That's Bill. He's hard to pigeonhole as being definitely anti-immigration or pro-immigration. He's going to take a middle stance where he'll seem to have positions on both sides of the fence."RICHARDSON: I'm a governor. I have to deal with this issue every day. Driver's licenses, law enforcement said to me we've got concerns about leaving the scene of a crime. If you want to find a way to keep illegal immigrants, you know where they are, you give them a driver's license. It helps with–they all get insured, it helps with traffic safety. I believe education is the key. Yeah, I was for kids of illegal immigrants, if they fulfill the same academic requirements as New Mexico kids, to be eligible for a scholarship. Tim, I believe we have to bring the 12 million undocumented workers out of the shadows, set up a standard where they speak English, if they pass background checks, pay back taxes, obey the laws, embrace American values, give them a chance, a path to citizenship, not amnesty.RUSSERT: That is amnesty.RICHARDSON: That–no, it isn't amnesty.RUSSERT: Would you send them back?RICHARDSON: They have to go back, under the law, to reapply.RUSSERT: The whole–all the families, entire families?RICHARDSON: No, just the head of household, under this bill. Under this...RUSSERT: You would–would you support that?RICHARDSON: If it's the head of household, and there's a visa requirement that they can come back, I think that's, that's all right. Look, this bill that Congress has made with the president, a good start. I acknowledge that. It has the basic elements. But the key problem with the bill now is it separates families. There are children of illegal immigrants that are American citizens because they're born here. That's the Constitution. What we need is a practical solution that involves foreign policy, saying to Mexico also, "Hey, you guys have to, you know, work to give your folks jobs...RUSSERT: But bottom line, you would want people who came here illegally to be able to stay here with their legally-born children?RICHARDSON: Yes. If they fulfill...RUSSERT: And become–and become U.S. citizens?RICHARDSON: Eventually, over a 12-year period, following those benchmarks that I mentioned.RUSSERT: Is that rewarding breaking the law?RICHARDSON: They have to pay a fine for breaking, for breaking the law. They have to do that.RUSSERT: But a couple thousand dollars isn't...RICHARDSON: No, well no, it's–I think one of the bills has close to 10. I–you know, this is a 400-page bill. I'm–look, this is not an excuse, I'm out on the campaign trail, I'm going one–every day, a different state. And–but I do believe that the Congress needs to fix this. Until then, I'm going to oppose it, because it's not right, Tim.RUSSERT: Let me show you a commercial you have seen quite a bit, but this is running on your behalf in some key states across the country, an ad paid for by the Richardson for President Committee. Let's watch.(Videotape, TV commercial)Unidentified Man: (To Richardson) Mm-hmm. Huh. OK, 14 years in Congress; U.N. ambassador; secretary of energy; governor of New Mexico; negotiated with dictators in Iraq, North Korea, Cuba, Zaire, Nigeria, Yugoslavia, Kenya; got a cease-fire in Darfur; nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize four times. So what makes you think you can be president?RICHARDSON: I'm Bill Richardson, and I approved this message.(End videotape)RUSSERT: You're running on your resume.RICHARDSON: I'm running on my record. And the reason for that ad, Tim, is look, I'm an insurgent candidate. You've got to do things differently. I'm also positive. You know, politicians take themselves too seriously. I've had–I've had ads that poked fun at myself, like this one. I was trying to make the case that I'm the best candidate to be president. I have the record. I've been a U.N. ambassador, I have foreign policy experience. I have energy experience, I know how to make us energy independent. I've been a governor, I've created 80,000 jobs, insured kids under five. New Mexico's economy is in good shape, because some of the policies we've taken. Our schools are better. I am trying to get over the fact that this should be an election not necessarily based on celebrity, not necessarily based on who has the most money, which I don't. But I am competitive. I'll have enough to get my message over. But that the American people need somebody that can bring this country together. And all my life I've done that, as, as a diplomat, as a, as a diplomatic troubleshooter, bringing hostages back. As a governor, as a congressman of 15 years. So yeah, I'm trying to draw attention not just to my, to my record, but the fact that I can bring people together. The country is bitterly divided. We need to regain our luster internationally. We need to regain our international moral authority, which we have lost after these six years. I believe I know how to bring America back internationally, be a president for the middle class, improve our schools, universal health care. That was what I'm trying to get through in that message.RUSSERT: But let's go through the resume a little bit. First, there's governor of New Mexico. As you well know, they rank states in a whole variety of categories from one being the best, 50th being the worst. This is New Mexico's scorecard, and you are the governor. Percent of people living below the poverty line, you're 48. Percent of children below, 48. Median family income, 47. People without health insurance, 49. Children without health insurance, 46. Teen high school dropouts, 47. Death rate due to firearms, 48. Violent crime rate, 46. You're the very bottom of all those statistics of all 50 states, and you're the governor for five years.RICHARDSON: Well, Tim, let me just say that we've made enormous progress in all of those areas. Let me, let me talk to you about child poverty. I followed eight years of a Republican administration that did not invest in health care. What I have done as governor is I've insured every child under five. Secondly, I've gotten rid of junk food in schools. Through my wife Barbara's efforts, we've increased immunization rates. We have expanded health care access to working families. As president, I would be a president for the middle class. I would deal with these poverty issues. What would I do as president? One, unionizing. That is critically important. Only 8 percent of our people are unionized. I think a union gives a family an opportunity for health care. I'd expand the child care tax credit. I would expand the earned income tax credit. I have cut taxes for the middle class in New Mexico. I have cut taxes for working moms. For working families I've cut taxes. We have significantly improved in the poverty area. I could give you similar statistics in health care and education, the...RUSSERT: But these rankings are troubling.RICHARDSON: Well, we're a poor state, Tim, but the fact is that we have been moving forward. And I was re-elected with 69 percent of the vote, 40 percent Republican. I have been given very strong rankings as a, as a governor. Governors deal with problems directly, Tim. This is why I believe historically this nation has elected governors. I balanced budgets five times. At the same time that I balance budgets, we've given tax cuts to every New Mexican. We've increased spending on education and health care to attack some of those problems that you've seen.RUSSERT: We're going to take a quick break and come back and talk more about your resume and about your position on the issues.RICHARDSON: Sure.RUSSERT: Bill Richardson is our guest, Meet the Candidates 2008 series. He's running for the Democratic presidential nomination. We'll be right back.(Announcements)RUSSERT: More of Meet the Candidates 2008, Democrat Bill Richardson. He's running for president, and he's the governor of New Mexico. After this station break.(Announcements)RUSSERT: We're back with Democratic candidate for president, Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico. We're talking about his background, his positions.You were secretary of energy. This is the way The Washington Post described your tenure: "On Richardson's watch at the Department of Energy, there were allegations that nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory had turned up in China. Richardson was roundly criticized in Congress for his handling of the alleged breach, for the botched case against Taiwan-born Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, and for lax security at the country's national labs. It killed his chance of becoming Al Gore's running mate in 2000." Do you agree with that?RICHARDSON: Well, it's probably true. But I believe I had a good record as secretary of energy. I got, for instance, energy efficiency in appliances. For example, air conditioning is 30 percent more energy efficient because of a–an initiative that I took. I helped with oil prices around the world by traveling to OPEC countries. I believe also we had significant advances in our nuclear proliferation initiatives with Russia and loose nuclear weapons. And lastly, I'm very proud of this, what I did, Tim. A lot of our nuclear workers, for years, had not gotten compensation for some of their medical cases because they were performing work in some of our nuclear weapons complexes. I pushed through the Congress an initiative that I started with some DOE officials to compensate those nuclear workers.Of course, yeah–we–I had a stormy tenure. We had some issues with the nuclear secrets issues and Wen Ho Lee. But I think on the whole I was a good energy secretary.RUSSERT: But this comment that you made in 1999, "I can assure the American people that their nuclear secrets are now safe at the labs." The–President Clinton's foreign intelligence advisory board, fellow members of your administration, said you should not have said that, it just wasn't true.RICHARDSON: That is correct, Tim. There were problems, and there have been ongoing problems, too, with nuclear secrets at the national laboratories. But I took action. I increased funding for cybersecurity. I ordered polygraph tests for some of the employees. It was very unpopular. We also appointed a security czar to deal with the problem. But the reality of those nuclear secrets, a week later after they were misplaced, or sometime later, they were found behind a copy machine. But there are still serious ongoing problems that need to be addressed.RUSSERT: And you should not have said that.RICHARDSON: I should not have said that. But I believe with the actions I took, I believe with the work of the FBI and the labs–I mean, I ordered very intensive actions that, that we had secured significantly some of those secrets.RUSSERT: You have put a very comprehensive energy plan on your Web site. You say you want to be the energy president. One thing that caught my interest was that nuclear power should be part of the mix. You're in favor of nuclear power?RICHARDSON: I believe it should be part of the mix. I'm not–I think the future for Americans' energy independence, and there I believe we need an Apollo program. And I believe I'm the greenest governor in this country.RUSSERT: What would you do with the nuclear waste?RICHARDSON: Well, what I would do, Tim, is I would–technology I think is the answer. I would not put it in Yucca Mountain, because when I was secretary it was obvious that it had environmental problems. It had water problems, there were issues relating to transporting that waste to Nevada. I don't believe there's another solution that has been advanced, and that is to store some of the waste at existing sites or in regional sites. I believe the answer is technology. What I would do is get our national laboratories to come up with a technological solution to dispose of this waste.RUSSERT: You also say that you would have fuel standards for automobiles to 50 miles per gallon in 2020. The automobile industry, Standard & Poor's, has now weighed in, saying that you could–that would increase the cost of a car or truck in this country by $6,000. The Detroit News editorialized that real possibility you could bankrupt the American automobile industry with that proposal.RICHARDSON: That's wrong. We must do it. We must become energy independent because it affects our national security. It affects–gasoline prices, this morning I saw the average around the country, $3.23. We must have fuel standards, and I believe it's realistic with a 100 mile-per-gallon flex-fuel vehicle, great technology that we can develop. Also requiring that, by that same year, Tim, that 30 percent of America's electricity be renewable energy. We have got to address global climate change by 2020, a reduction of 20 percent greenhouse gas emissions, mandatory cap and trade system.Look, Tim, you know, here in Washington, all you hear about is this is not possible, it won't pass the Congress. We must do it. I would lead an Apollo program like John F. Kennedy did–and I'm no John F. Kennedy–that–like when he went to the moon in 10 years, I believe we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil–which is imported oil, which is 65 percent, that is dangerous, countries that are not friendly to us–to 10 percent, with massive public and private investment in renewable technologies, in solar, wind, biomass, fuel cells, distributed generation, renewable fuels, ethanol, biodiesel, biofuels, investments, tax incentives, and conservation. I would ask the American people–you know, I'm going to say a word that may not be very popular–to sacrifice a little bit for the common good, to be greener in their way of life–lighting, appliances, air conditioning, when it comes to washing machines, driving efficient vehicles.But back to your vehicles issue, Tim. We have the technology to have fuel efficient engines. We had a program at the Department of Energy with the auto companies, with Toyota, with the Japanese companies, to develop batteries and fuel cells and efficient engines, so that you can have an SUV, but with a fuel efficient engine that somehow helps us–you know what? What, what really upset me, I just saw that the Bush administration once again said to the Germans we're not going to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, just like the rest of the world should. I would launch a major diplomatic initiative to say to China and India and developing countries that America is going to be a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a cap and trade system that is mandatory. We have to do these things on a mandatory basis.RUSSERT: Governor, when you left your position as secretary of energy, however, you did join two boards–Valero Energy and Diamond Offshore Drilling. Valero Energy, as you know, they are very much involved in refinering–refining. The chairman, then CEO, Bill Greehey, boasted that tighter supplies of gasoline "had provided outstanding profit margins for us. The outlook for the next year is even better," as the Boston Herald says, which means for car drivers even worse. You have significant stock holdings in that company. Would you divest yourself of a company that is bragging about all the money they made over higher gasoline prices?RICHARDSON: Well, I already got rid of the stock.RUSSERT: It's gone?RICHARDSON: Yeah.RUSSERT: Do you regret going on their board?RICHARDSON: No. No, I don't. I have to earn a living. I left–remember, when we left the Clinton administration in 2000, I had to earn a living. I'm not against oil companies per se. Why, why would I–I'm no against oil production. I strongly favor renewable energy, and I believe the oil companies, you know, should not get the tax breaks they're getting.RUSSERT: But you made a lot of money off the company.RICHARDSON: No, I didn't make a lot of–compared to other candidates–come on, Tim, you know that. I, I went on those two boards. I also went on the board for the Natural Resources Defense Council, the strongest environmental organization. There's nothing wrong with being on energy boards. I have to earn a living.RUSSERT: Is there...RICHARDSON: I'd always been in government.RUSSERT: Is there anything wrong with outstanding profit margins, the outlook is brighter for the future because of tighter supplies?RICHARDSON: Well, look, I do believe some of the tax breaks in the last energy bill that the oil companies, coal and nuclear are getting, I would get rid of those. I've always been very outspoken on these issues. I don't believe there's anything wrong with trying to earn a living.RUSSERT: On a company that makes money off high–higher gasoline prices for consumers.RICHARDSON: It's a refining company. It's a good company, Tim. And that, that guy the CEO is a first-rate individual who cares about energy security in this country.RUSSERT: Let me turn to gun control, and this is an article from your Sante Fe Mexican newspaper. "Listening to U.S. Representative Bill Richardson"–senior congressman–"explain his position on gun control to a Sante Fe audience is like watching Fred Astaire dance. 'I voted to repeal the assault weapons ban because it's always been my view that occasionally a member of Congress on an issue where he or she has some difficulty in justifying a vote, that I should respect the wishes of my constituents. In this case, the strong majority favor repealing the ban. That doesn't mean it's the right vote.'"You voted to ban assault weapons, uzis, street sweepers, then you voted to repeal it, and you're basically saying, "Well I know it's not the right vote but my constituents want it, therefore, I'll give it to them."RICHARDSON: Well, listen, I know–I've been in public life 25 years. I was the whip when President Clinton was–I was the whip, in other words, in charge of getting some of those votes for the crime bill, which put 100,000 cops on the street, which took some of those initiatives. But, look, Tim, you know, I–I'm a gun owner. I'm a western governor. I believe the issue is not gun control. The issue, as, as happened in, in Virginia Tech where I, I just–those–the tragedy there, the issue is instant background checks. I am for instant background–I am for a bill that Carolyn McCarthy is doing now in the House of Representatives which tightens background checks, which, which says...RUSSERT: Well, why do hunters need street sweepers or uzi machine guns. You voted to ban those. As president, would you seek to ban assault weapons.RICHARDSON: Tim, Tim, the assault weapons ban did not work. It didn't work.RUSSERT: So you would...RICHARDSON: It didn't work.RUSSERT: You wouldn't do that as president?RICHARDSON: It didn't work. What I would do is I would focus more of our efforts–for instance, background checks with those with criminal backgrounds and the mentally ill. We have to tighten up those background checks. I am for doing that. I am for do–but the problem is the states don't have the database, the resources.RUSSERT: OK. You received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, NRA, running for governor. There's a picture of you at their podium heartily accepting their endorsement. Would you accept the endorsement of the NRA for president?RICHARDSON: Yes, I would. I'm a gun owner. You know, Tim, gun control shouldn't be a litmus test in the Democratic Party. I am for reasonable controls on–I don't want to see uzis when you're hunting, obviously, but...RUSSERT: But you wouldn't ban them.RICHARDSON: ...this is the West. But, Tim, I'm a western governor. It's a cultural issue. I am for strong law enforcement, putting criminals–I have a very strong law enforcement record. I believe it's not necessarily a gun control issue. Let's look at some of the issues affecting the mentally ill, the fact that mental health doesn't have parity with other illnesses. The instant background checks are critically important. I'm for that. You don't want anybody with a criminal background or mentally ill having these–and I think Representative McCarthy, who is one of the strongest advocates for gun control is–I am for that.RUSSERT: But the–being the NRA's man is not going to be popular in some Democratic primaries.RICHARDSON: Well, I–you know, I don't, I don't change my positions to run for president.RUSSERT: Well, you did on assault weapons.RICHARDSON: I don't change my positions.RUSSERT: But you did change it on assault weapons.RICHARDSON: But, Tim, that was a vote as part of an overall bill that President Clinton proposed.RUSSERT: Let me move on to Gonzales–Alberto Gonzales, the attorney general. You called for his resignation.RICHARDSON: Yeah.RUSSERT: You were reluctant to do so–earlier because you said he was Hispanic.RICHARDSON: Yeah.RUSSERT: And people said, "How could race play into that?" Just because he's Hispanic and you're Hispanic, you gave him a little more license to do things that you didn't agree with?RICHARDSON: Yeah, I did. I'm not perfect. You know, I–you know, you want candidates that are–their consultants tell them, oh, on the one hand; on the other hand. I gave him two extra days before I called for, for his resignation because he deserved a day in court. He went to the Senate Judiciary Committee. And then, in my judgment, he failed. He failed to answer questions. It was obvious he was politicizing the Justice Department. It was obvious that he was acting as if he was the lawyer for the president and the White House staff, a political lawyer, rather than the lawyer for the American people.RUSSERT: But when you say he did it because he's Hispanic, you're suggesting, "If he was white, black or Asian, I wouldn't have done it."RICHARDSON: No, no, no. This is what I said, and, and this is what I feel. Look, the guy, a migrant worker's family, the highest ranking Hispanic in history. There's a human side to politics, Tim. And, and I'm, I'm admitting it. I said I gave him a few extra days. I, I have called for his resignation. And I was just really upset when I heard that he went to the–to, to, to Attorney General Aschcroft at the hospital in Georgetown trying to get him to sign an illegal eavesdropping–that really upset me. And I'd never thought I'd cheer for John Ashcroft, but I'm cheering for him now. But, you, you know, yeah. I, I admitted that. You're going to see me, I am, I am not a model of perfection. I believe I have strong principles. I believe that I am somebody that is going to tell the truth. I'm an unvarnished candidate. Yeah. I, I admitted that.RUSSERT: Well, another example of that, when Brian Williams asked you in the debate who your model Supreme Court justice was, you said Whizzer White, who is Byron White, appointed by President Kennedy. He wrote the dissent against Roe v. Wade for abortion rights. When you were told that the next day, you said, "That couldn't have happened. He was there in the '60s." Well, he served on the bench until 1993. I mean, shouldn't the president know who a Supreme Court justice is, how long he served, and what opinions he wrote?RICHARDSON: You know, Whizzer White–I love John F. Kennedy. He's my hero in politics. He appointed Whizzer White. Whizzer White was a legal scholar. Whizzer White was an all-American football player. But he was also a legal scholar. By the way...RUSSERT: You disagree with him on Roe v. Wade.RICHARDSON: He is...RUSSERT: Let's do a do–let's do a do-over. Who is your model Supreme Court justice?RICHARDSON: I would say two: Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who wrote the dissenting opinion on, on the abortion issue, who I think is a distinguished scholar. Earl Warren, you know, who led a number of civil rights efforts. But, you know, I did not know that record of Whizzer White when I said that. I mean, Brian...RUSSERT: So we're off, we're off Whizzer White now?RICHARDSON: Well, yeah. But, but, you know, he, he has said–I checked up afterwards–he said he was, I think he said something on, on the, he was for the right to choose, but he dissented on the opinion. Look, I was asked, I shouldn't have said that. So you're going to–I've been in public life 25 years. You're going to find a lot of these. It seems you've found them all here.RUSSERT: Well, I'm just trying to set the record and trying to give you a chance to respond, which is fair.RICHARDSON: OK. No, yeah, that's fine.RUSSERT: One other thing that has surfaced in the campaign is that your resumes and other things had always said that you were drafted in major league baseball since 1966 by the Kansas City A's. You now say you were not drafted.RICHARDSON: Well, at the time, if you look at that year, Tim, the draft was just starting. I was offered a contract, $25,000, by a, a, a, a Houston Colts scout by the name of Jack Johnson, who has a notarized statement that said that he–I was offered this. So I assumed that having been offered this, I had been drafted. And then when I played in the Cape Cod League as a pitcher, my arm was already starting to go because I'd thrown too many curveballs, that, that was in the program. So I always assumed it had happened. I made a mistake. I should have checked. But I was a decent player until I was about 21.RUSSERT: You spent a lot of time in, in Massachusetts. Are you a Red Sox fan?RICHARDSON: I'm a Red Sox fan, but I got into trouble in New Hampshire. You know why? Because I said...RUSSERT: Luis Tiant, the fund-raiser. But, now, governor, this is very serious. In your book on page 18 it says...RICHARDSON: No, about Mickey Mantle?RUSSERT: You said you're a Yankee fan!RICHARDSON: No, no, no. I said–no, no, no.RUSSERT: I mean, you can, you can...RICHARDSON: No, no, no, no.RUSSERT: ...you can have different views on immigration, assault weapons...RICHARDSON: I, no no no no. No, what I said...RUSSERT: But when it comes to Red Sox, Yankees.RICHARDSON: What I said, the Associated Press asked me, "If you weren't running for president, if you weren't running for president, what would you rather be?" I've always been a Red Sox fan, but I said if I weren't running for president I would like to be number seven, Mickey Mantle, playing center field for the New York Yankees.RUSSERT: "Because of Mickey Mantle, I became a Yankee fan."RICHARDSON: I, my favorite team has always been the Red Sox.RUSSERT: You're a Red Sox fan.RICHARDSON: I'm a Red Sox fan.RUSSERT: End of subject.RICHARDSON: End of subject.RUSSERT: You better get rid of this book.RICHARDSON: Oh, no! I'm also a Yankee fan. I also like...RUSSERT: Oh, now, wait a minute!RICHARDSON: You can–Tim...RUSSERT: I guarantee...RICHARDSON: No, I know, I got in trouble...RUSSERT: ...if you go–if you go to Yankee Stadium or Fenway, you cannot be both.RICHARDSON: But I like–Mickey Mantle was my hero. If I weren't running for president, and the Associated Press asked me, I'd play center field for the New York–I wanted to be number seven. And–but I still love the Red Sox as a team. I mean, this is the thing about me, Tim. I can bring people together. I can unify people.RUSSERT: Yankee fans and Red Sox fans?RICHARDSON: Yes.RUSSERT: Not a chance.RICHARDSON: Well, I bet you I can.RUSSERT: Before you go, Iowa. Way back in '88, after the Democrats had not been successful winning the presidency, you said this: "One of Richardson's ideas for the Democrats' next try at the presidency is to stop holding their first primary in Iowa because of the predominance of special interests in that state." You still say that?RICHARDSON: 1988? RUSSERT: Yeah. Do you still share that view?RICHARDSON: No.RUSSERT: You love Iowa.RICHARDSON: No, I love Iowa.RUSSERT: I thought so.RICHARDSON: You know, let me just say something. I've been campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. Those voters really scrutinize you, and I am for them staying as number one. I hope they move up their primaries because I believe that those states have–they, they feel that responsibility of scrutinizing everybody, they're issue-oriented.RUSSERT: So Iowa no longer...RICHARDSON: Well, that was 1988. I mean, I...RUSSERT: So they no longer have a predominance of special interests?RICHARDSON: No, I haven't noted any.RUSSERT: Governor Bill Richardson, we thank you for joining us and sharing your views for the full hour.RICHARDSON: Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here today. I think this conference is one of the most important events that all of us, as candidates, will attend this year. And I'd like to tell you why it's important to me personally. I first got involved in public service after meeting Hubert Humphrey in 1971, while I was in graduate school. Despite his narrow defeat in the 1968 presidential election, he hadn't lost his idealism. He challenged me and the other students I was with to try and make a difference with our lives -- to look at the world around us and seek out the inequality that's sometimes plain to see ... and other times hidden from view ... and to give our best effort to heal our nation. This is a hauntingly similar time. Like 1968, we are a nation deep into an unwanted war, the president has lost the country, there is hurt and sorrow among our people, and there is a sense that no matter who is elected, we have a long road in front of us. But there is great risk in taking only this view. When you listen to some who are running for president, you can hear it in their voices. There is weight to their words. But they are in danger of being weighed down by it all. I am optimistic about our country. I am optimistic about the Democratic Party. We have the majority in Congress ... the American people agree with us on the issues ... we have the best field of candidates for president ... and we're going to put a Democrat into the White House. Yes, there is too much that is wrong with America. But we can also celebrate what's finally going right. The first step was taking back the Congress. The next step is taking back the White House. That's how we take back America. I am going to focus my remarks today on repairing the damage from the two worst mistakes of the Bush administration -- failing to address climate change and failing to change our policies in Iraq. Some people poke fun at how I like to talk about what I've done as a Governor. But I'm proud of New Mexico ... and I'm proud of making New Mexico the clean energy state. In fact, we're doing more to clean up the environment and fight global warming than any other state in the country. Mark Twain said "Everybody complains about the weather but nobody ever does anything about it." Well, we're doing something about global warming in New Mexico. We're requiring utility companies to produce energy from renewable sources ... we've invested directly in energy efficiency ... we're promoting renewable energy with tax credits for using wind, solar, and biofuels ... we've eliminated taxes on hybrid cars ... and I set tough standards to reduce greenhouse emissions. Maybe the country and President Bush don't follow the Kyoto treaty, but my state does. Of course, in his typical fashion, after six and a half years of refusing to admit that global warming exists, President Bush has started lecturing developing nations and telling them to clean up their act. I'm not sure what's more insulting to the rest of the world. Telling them they're wrong for six and a half years. Or changing your mind and telling them they're still wrong. Mr. President, we don't need half-hearted half-way measures like the European agreement that just came out of the G-8 Summit. The Kyoto Treaty has been sitting on your desk for six and a half years. You might as well sign it now, because in a year and a half, if you haven't, I will. I'm proud to have the most aggressive plan of anyone running for president. Within twelve years, my plan would reduce global warming pollution by 20 percent, lower demand for oil by fifty percent, and push fuel economy standards to 50 miles per gallon. By the year 2040, my plan would require that 50 percent of our electricity be generated from renewable sources and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent. You can read the plan for yourself at my campaign website or you can listen to the League of Conservation Voters. They rated it the most aggressive plan with the highest goals of any other candidate. These aren't pie in the sky proposals, but they are ambitious. If we can spend billions waging war in a country that never had weapons of mass destruction ... then we can certainly find the will to stop the mass destruction of our planet. It's time that we as a nation chose the collective good over the desire to collect goods. And frankly, buying carbon offsets isn't enough. Just like paying somebody else to go to church doesn't make you religious ... paying somebody else to conserve doesn't make you a conservationist. My wife Barbara and I use both a hybrid and a flex-fuel vehicle, and we've made the New Mexico Governor's Mansion a lot more energy efficient, including compact fluorescent lighting, low water-use irrigation, and ceiling fans to cut down on air conditioning -- and lemme tell you, on a 95 degree day in New Mexico, that's a sacrifice! But I know we can do more, and I'll bet that a lot of you could, too. We all have to sacrifice for the common good ... and we have to end our dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Which brings us to Iraq ... Some will tell you that we only have two options: either stay in Iraq and try to referee a civil war ... or leave and watch the Middle East collapse into a regional war. When a president decides that he or she only has two bad options, guess what happens? Something bad. I have a different view ... a more optimistic view grounded in what I call a New Realism for foreign policy. I applaud my fellow Democratic candidates for taking on President Bush in the Congress. But there is a fundamental difference in this campaign -- and that's how many troops each of us would leave behind. Other than the customary marine contingent at the embassy, I would leave zero troops. Not a single one. And if the embassy and our embassy personnel aren't safe, then they're all coming home too. No airbases. No troops in the Green Zone. No embedded soldiers training Iraqi forces, because we all know what that means. It means our troops would still be out on patrol with targets on their backs. A regional crisis is worthy of military intervention. A true threat to our country's security is worthy of war. But a struggle between a country's warring factions, where both sides hate the United States, is not worthy of one more lost American life. With all due respect to my Democratic colleagues ... Senators Clinton, Obama, Dodd, and Biden all voted for timeline legislation that had deliberate loopholes. Those loopholes allow this president, or any president, to leave an undetermined number of troops in Iraq indefinitely.1 And this is the same legislation that former Senator Edwards says we should send back to President Bush over and over again until he signs it. The language in the legislation was clear. It would allow the president to leave American troops behind for quote "training and equipping members of the Iraqi Security Forces" ... and to protect, among other things, quote "other U.S. forces." 2 Troops protecting troops ... potentially thousands of troops, year after year. I don't know about the other folks running, but troops protecting troops training other troops doesn't sound any different to me. Clearly, my Democratic colleagues in this campaign think it's responsible to have an ongoing military role in Iraq. They voted not once but twice to leave troops behind. Senator Clinton has told her military advisor that if she were elected, there might still be troops in Iraq at end of her second term. Senator Obama's written plan calls for leaving non-combat troops in Iraq. And Senator Edwards says he's for withdrawing all troops except those at the embassy. But that's not what the bill says that he wants to pass again and again. The responsible thing to do is to look at the problem from another perspective. At the rate we're losing American lives, over one thousand American troops will be killed this year alone. The surge has led to nothing but a surge in Americans dying. Over 70 percent of Iraqis want us out of their country. Over 60 percent think it's okay to kill Americans. Think about that for a second. Over 60 percent were willing to tell a pollster they'd never met before that it's okay to kill Americans ... which means that percentage is probably even higher. That's not the case in Japan, Germany, South Korea or anywhere else American troops are stationed. I have great respect for my fellow Democratic candidates, but for those who think we should leave a residual force, how long does that force need to be in place before we can leave? One year? Two years? Five? Ten? There is not a single sign that Iraq is improving. To the contrary, every indication is that it's getting worse, and a smaller force will do nothing to change that. How many more Americans must die before we leave an Iraq that will be no better off than it is today? And in a war where American troops are the number one target, who are the poor souls you're going to leave behind? We need to bring them all home. You can sign our petition at No Troops Left Behind dot com. The way we help heal Iraq is to bring all of our troops home within six months. Only then can the hard diplomatic work really begin. That's how we avoid a regional war. I would leave troops in neighboring countries that want us, like Kuwait, to help keep the peace. But we need to hand over security of Iraq to an all Muslim peacekeeping force. We would then have a moral responsibility to do everything we can to bring the different factions together in a national reconciliation conference. We also have a strategic interest in organizing a regional conference with all of Iraq's neighbors, including Syria and Iran, to help stabilize Iraq. No one in the region, including Iran, wants an Iraqi civil war ... and no one in the region, especially Iran, wants Iraqi refugees. Some will tell you that once we leave Iraq, the country will become a hotbed of Al Qaeda activity. That's just not the case. There is an old Arab proverb -- "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." Up until now, Al Qaeda was tolerated in Iraq because they were killing Americans. Once we're gone, the Iraqis will have no further use for Al Qaeda and they will drive them out. We're seeing the beginnings of this already in Sunni attacks on Al Qaeda, but the process will accelerate once we're gone. Too many Iraqis have died at the hands of Al Qaeda and retaliation will be at hand. Two months ago in North Korea, I was proud to help show how talking to your enemies can produce results, like reducing the North Korean nuclear threat and bringing home the remains of six American servicemen. The situation is similar in the Middle East. This president broke Iraq. The next president has to know how to use diplomacy to fix it. I will tell you this -- my world view is different from my colleagues. In my career, I've been able to get results, not with harsh words, but hard work. You talk to your adversaries. You listen. You get to know them well if you want them to hear what you're saying. And with understanding comes resolve. And with clarity comes cooperation. It's how I've approached foreign affairs. It's how I've approached governing. And it's how I'll serve as president of this great country. More than anything else, we have a moral obligation to those American soldiers and citizens who've laid down their lives overseas. Some say we cannot let their sacrifice be in vain. But you will never convince me that those slain patriots would have wanted a single additional life to be lost ... just to validate their own sacrifice. Instead, the moral obligation is to honor their service by bringing their mission to a close. By ending the bloodshed ... and finally letting the Iraqi people and the American people to set a new course. Those would be the principles of my presidency. And those would be the ideals I'd seek. Thank you, God bless you, God bless our troops, God bless the Democratic Party, and God bless New Mexico. 1. H.R. 1591, SEC 1904 (e) (1-4) (supplemental appropriations bill); and Reid-Feingold, S. 1097.2. H.R. 1591, SEC 1904 (e) (4) (supplemental appropriations bill) Thank you for that kind introduction, and your warm welcome. It's wonderful being in this amazing memorial to the National Guard. I've always stood with our armed forces, and I feel the grandeur and solemnity of this hall matches the solemnity of the challenges we face. I am especially pleased to be here today because of CNP's longstanding work on the issue of nuclear security. As Secretary of Energy and as a presidential envoy to North Korea, I know there are few issues that deserve more attention from Congress than keeping the world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous people. With the important backing of the MacArthur Foundation, CNP has brought the right kind of bi-partisan attention to this issue, and I thank you. Two months ago, I returned from a trip to North Korea that represented a bipartisan effort to achieve two major goals -- to bring home the remains of American servicemen missing since the Korean War, and to facilitate international efforts to persuade the North Korean government to roll back its nuclear weapons program. Let me emphasize two key words here -- bipartisan and international. In this bipartisan effort involving two senior officials of the current administration -- Anthony Principi and Victor Cha -- our delegation was successful on both counts. We brought home the remains of six US servicemen who died defending freedom during the Korean War. The sacrifice they made can be now be fully honored by their families, friends, and country. In North Korea, we also advanced the Six-Party process by which North Korea will dismantle its nuclear weapons program and become more integrated into the international community. This process is far from complete, and could still be derailed. But our discussions with North Korea demonstrated how skillful diplomacy, grounded in bipartisan cooperation and international alliances, can strengthen our national security. I mention all this because I believe these same components are what are needed to deal successfully with Iran. First, let me say that I am under no illusions that achieving similar goals with Iran will be easy. But I am convinced that a concerted diplomatic effort, backed up by tough sanctions, undertaken with our international partners and grounded in bipartisan cooperation at home, stands an excellent chance of persuading Iran to forego nuclear weapons and to adopt more responsible policies. I also believe that we must talk to the Iranians with no preconditions. For too long, the Bush administration lectured the Iranian leadership on what it had to do before we would talk directly with them. This policy was counterproductive, and I am pleased that Secretary Rice is now starting to break this ice. Refusing to engage Iran diplomatically prevented us from making headway on issues vital to our national security, including not only nuclear weapons, but also Iraq, energy security, and Middle East peace. Let me be clear: talking without preconditions does not mean backing off one inch over fundamental objectives, such as insuring that Iran never acquires nuclear weapons. But preventing Iran from going nuclear will require strong diplomacy backed up credible power and clarity of purpose. It also will take realism: we must remember that no nation has ever been forced to renounce nukes -- but many have been persuaded to do so with a combination of carrots and sticks.We need to approach Iran with both fierce determination and with open eyes. The key is to make them see that they will be better off and more secure without nukes than with them. If we unite the world behind the right carrots and sticks, and provide the Iranians with face-saving ways to step back from the nuclear brink, we will prevail. As we know from the Cold War, deterrence is above all a matter of clarity and credibility. We need to be absolutely clear that a nuclear Iran is unacceptable, and we need to be absolutely credible when we say what we will do about it if the Iranians continue to disregard the will of the international community. The clear message must be this: develop nukes and you will face devastating global sanctions. Desist from developing nukes and you will receive meaningful rewards, including robust security guarantees and guaranteed supplies of nuclear fuel from abroad. This sort of engagement, with a stick in one hand and a carrot in the other, is how we got Libya to renounce nukes, and this is how we must approach Iran. Centrality of the Iran Problem There are at least six major reasons why Iran is strategically significant. These are: (1) its nuclear ambitions; (2) its importance to stability in Iraq; (3) its support for extreme Arab factions -- such as Hezbollah and Hamas -- who themselves are obstacles to stability in Lebanon and to the Palestinian-Israeli peace process; (4) its status as a major oil and gas producer; (5) its importance to the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz; and (6) its role as leader of the world's Islamic Shia population.I will address these issues in a moment, as I outline how I believe a vigorous bipartisan and international diplomatic effort should seek to engage Iran. First, however, any discussion of US policy must deal with what I call the "Weight of History" that has shackled US-Iranian relations for decades. The 1979 Iranian Revolution, and the ordeal of the American hostages who spent 444 days in captivity, has poisoned relations between the US and Iran for nearly 30 years. And many Iranians still chafe because of US support for the 1953 coup which toppled their elected government. Inflammatory rhetoric like "The Great Satan" and the "Axis of Evil" for decades has impeded most rational dialogue. I would be the last to make excuses for extremists in Iran's political establishment. Their hostility towards Israel, their denial of the Holocaust, and their documented support for international terrorism, must always be condemned. And we must have no illusions about President Ahmadinejad- a dangerous man with truly reprehensible views. But I also believe that peace comes to those who have the courage to learn from their own errors. We should recognize that US support for the Shah's repressive regime, and then for Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s -- and the US government's silence when Saddam used chemical weapons against Iran -- were wrong. These and other mistakes on our part -- like the many mistakes Iranians have made -- have left wounds that are still deeply felt in both societies. Both we and the Iranians need to acknowledge this difficult shared history, and work to get beyond it. The road to peace is hard: it is difficult to forgive past injustices and outrages. But for the good of America, and for the good of Iran, and for the sake of peace, both nations must focus not on the past, but on the future. What Does Iran Want? Iran is a country that is three times larger than France, with a population of 70 million. Its lands are rich in the history and culture of a Persian empire that stretches back 6,000 years. Its people are understandably proud of their heritage and their contributions to art, science, and learning. Despite our preoccupation with the radical views of many of its rulers, it is also true that Iran has some elements of a modern democracy. Despite the iron grip of its religious establishment, Iranians hold many different views on such fundamental political concepts as the role of religion in society, and the need for democratic freedoms. What all Iranians share, however, is a deeply felt national pride and a desire that their country be respected and recognized for its history and its accomplishments. In my dealings with North Korea, and with other hard-line governments around the world, I have learned that a basic level of respect for -- and understanding of -- your adversary is crucial for agreements to be reached. Name-calling and refusal to talk to people get you nowhere. Indeed, they usually backfire on you by strengthening your adversary's most obstructionist and hard-line elements. I have quoted John F. Kennedy many times before, and his words are just as true regarding Iran: "we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate." As we seek to deal with Iran, we need to recognize that country's national pride and its own perceptions of threats to its security. We also must understand that the following are Iran's main policy goals: They want their legitimate right to civilian nuclear technologies as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be respected;They want stability on their borders, most notably with Iraq and Afghanistan -- and they DON'T want the civil war in Iraq to spin out of control, with millions of Iraqi refugees spilling into Iran and other neighboring countries;They want to be free of external security threats, either from within the region (Israel) or outside the region (the United States);They want to be able to develop regional energy and economic partnerships;They want integration into the global economy, including membership in the World Trade Organization and an end to trade and financial embargoes; Clearly, Iran's own behavior has been counter-productive to these ends, and Iran must vastly improve its policies before it may expect other nations to accept it as a legitimate major player on the global stage. Above all, Iran must start respecting UN resolutions and stop supporting international terrorists. And President Ahmadinejad needs to stop threatening Israel and denying the Holocaust. We have many differences with the Iranians, but we and our allies also have common interests with them. It behooves us all to seek and find that common ground, so that we can encourage the Iranians to come out of the cold, and to build more constructive relationships not just with us, but also with the international community. As my friend, the great Israeli general and statesman Yitzak Rabin, used to say, "You make peace with your enemies, not your friends." The Iranians' choices ultimately are theirs, but our choices are ours. If our diplomacy is solid and smart, we can help them make better choices than they have in the past. What Do We Want from Iran?  Iran must not acquire nuclear weapons: virtually the entire international community agrees about this. The P5+1 countries -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the US, UK, Russia, China and France) plus Germany -- have been negotiating with Iran, and in June 2006 offered the Iranians a package of incentives to give up their nuclear enrichment efforts. The P5+1 package represents an excellent starting point for negotiations which, I believe, can result in a diplomatic solution that keeps Iran from developing nuclear weapons and also achieves progress on a range of regional and international economic and security issues. The June 2006 package included the following important elements:  Acknowledgment of Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy;The creation of a five-year fuel bank/buffer stock of nuclear fuel for Iran;An international fuel-cycle center in Russia involving Iran;An energy partnership among Iran, the European Union, and othersTrade and investment incentives;A regional security forum involving Iran, other regional states, the US, Russia and China;A willingness on the part of the United States to talk directly with Iran. On this last point, our country has other interests that we must discuss directly with Iran, including:  Iran's help in forging stable governments in Iraq and Afghanistan; The end of threats and inflammatory rhetoric against Israel; Concrete and verifiable steps to end military support for Hezbollah, Hamas, and other violent groups. The achievement of these goals would constitute a fundamental change in Iran's role in the world. Fortunately, there is reason for optimism that Iran might well choose to chart such a new course if presented with the right incentives. First of all, the Iranian economy is in trouble -- and high unemployment and widespread discontent are a threat to the regime's political future. Despite being one of the world's largest oil producers, Iran has only one refinery, and imports more than $ 4 billion a year of refined oil products. It imports half its gasoline and food. Double-digit inflation, high unemployment, low infrastructure investment, and burdensome government subsidies of $40 billion a year shackle economic growth, and the resulting hardship puts the kind of political pressure on the regime that produced perestroika in the Soviet Union twenty years ago. The international community can leverage these realities to induce Tehran to reform as well, and to recognize that Iran's future lies with its integration into the global economy and the community of peace-loving nations. Both China and Russia have considerable economic leverage over Iran, and the threat of disinvestment could put great pressure on the regime. It is essential that our diplomacy with these other great powers be strong and skillful. However, no constructive dialogue with Iran is possible until we break the vicious cycle of suspicion and hostile, incendiary rhetoric. If we want Iran to improve its behavior, we would do well to stop threatening to attack them. And we should not fund Iranian émigré groups in the delusional expectation that they will somehow be able to topple the regime. The Bush administration foolishly tried this approach with Iraq, and we know what it got us. There is no reason to expect better results with Iran. We need to stop threatening the Iranians and talking about regime change. Instead, we need to start applying meaningful pressure, while working with them to change their behavior. We also must dialogue with moderate and pragmatic elements in both the Iranian political class and in the broader society, including business people and students who have supported moderate politicians in the past, and may do so again in the future. How Do We Get There? So, how do we proceed? As you know, US government representatives have met recently with Iranian officials to discuss Iraq, and there have also been US-Iranian meetings to talk about Afghanistan and our shared interest in preventing a return to power by the Taliban. These are all steps in the right direction, but the US needs to go further and propose broad, bilateral, unconditional negotiations with Iran -- with all subjects open for discussion. Support for such talks has come from many figures in the US foreign policy establishment, including Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski. We need to end the taboo on open-ended talks, so that we can begin serious, continuing, and senior-level negotiations on the full range of nuclear, Middle East security, and economic issues. Only in the context of intensifying dialogue can we start to communicate better with Iran, and to find ways to reconcile our differences. Our message to Iran must always have two components:  We must respect their legitimate right to peaceful nuclear energy, and we must let them know that gestures toward peace and reconciliation will be reciprocated with meaningful economic benefits and security guarantees;We must stand absolutely firm with our international partners in letting the Iranians know that we will never allow them to acquire nuclear weapons, and that they will pay a high price if they continue to support international terrorists.  In short the message to the Iranians must be clear: work with the international community and you will be safe and prosperous. Continue to defy the international community and you will suffer and economically- and politically-damaging international sanctions. US-Iran bilateral talks will occur within the broader context of on-going discussions with Iran being conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the European Union, and Russia and China. Each of these partners can bring special points of leverage to bear on different matters. The IAEA naturally has the lead on nuclear issues, while the European Union can be helpful on trade and finance issues and helping to integrate Iran into the global economy. Russia and China have been moving toward greater energy cooperation with Iran. And there are other actors who have important stakes in helping to facilitate more moderate behavior on the part of Iran. One is the Gulf Cooperation Council, whose members have recently expressed greater interest in civilian nuclear power -- as a direct consequence of Iran's push for mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle. Led by Saudi Arabia, the Sunni-dominated GCC countries are apprehensive about Iranian regional ambitions and support for radical Shia groups. There are also the other Sunni Arab countries in the Middle East -- Egypt and Jordan especially -- who fear destabilization of the region that would naturally flow from heightened US-Iran tensions and possible conflict. A crucial point I would like to stress here is the need for a more intelligent and effective American policy towards the entire Middle East that we have seen in recent years. I have said before that there is a civil war within Islam between extremists and moderates. We must open an ideological front in the war against violent Jihadism, which is the single biggest threat our country faces. To do that, we must do everything we can to isolate the extremists and to strengthen moderates across the Islamic world. And a good place to begin is with Iran -- where pragmatists and moderates are waiting in the wings as hard-line policies fail and as President Amadenejad's popularity continues to slide. We need urgently to re-engage the Middle East peace process with a high-level permanent envoy tasked with building the bases for a just peace. Continued deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process will only provide aid and comfort to our enemies in the Islamic world. We must use all our sticks and carrots to strengthen Palestinian moderates and to promote a two-state solution that guarantees Israel's security. In the Persian Gulf, we need to work constructively with both Sunni Arabs and Shia Iranians on a wide range of security, economic, and energy initiatives that will promote stability in that crucial part of the world. In the Levant, we need to talk directly to Syria in order to foster political stability in Lebanon and to encourage an Israeli-Syrian agreement on the Golan Heights. And then there's Iraq. The crisis in Iraq threatens to destabilize the entire region, and to make many other Middle East problems unsolvable. I won't dwell here on Iraq, having done so on other occasions. Suffice it to say that the US military presence in that country is now part of the problem, not the solution. The presence of American troops in Iraq fuels the insurgency and strengthens Al Qaeda. I strongly believe that the complete withdrawal of all US military from Iraq will have a salutary effect on all of our goals in the region, including our efforts to build a better relationship with Iran, and to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Summary What I have outlined tonight is an ambitious, but achievable, diplomatic agenda. Negotiating directly with Iran will be difficult and may take time to produce results. Much will depend on Iranian leaders recognizing that their current policies -- especially their nuclear policies -- are counterproductive if Iran truly wants better security and economic growth. Most experts believe that Iran is still several years away from being capable of building nuclear weapons. We should use that time constructively to build peace, rather than rushing toward another catastrophic war. At the same time as we initiate a new dialogue with Iran, we must redouble our diplomatic efforts across the region, beginning with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We must engage and support moderate Arabs and Muslims everywhere in their struggle with Islamist extremists. And we must get our military out of Iraq so that a new diplomatic process -- which inevitably must include Iran -- can begin. None of these problems exists in isolation from the other. As we know from the experience of the last several years, multiple setbacks across the Middle East have increased the dangers to our security. This is still another reason for having a full-time permanent US diplomatic envoy in the region. Now is the time for a New Realist vision of how American leadership, in concerted effort with our partners, can turn the situation around. This vision cannot be based on regime change and the misapplication of military power. It must be based upon strong diplomacy backed up by credible military power, solid alliances and partnerships, and economic engagement. Iran holds the key to many of the crucial security variables of the greater Middle East. That is why a full-court press on engaging Iran -- with no preconditions, and no illusions -- is in the American national security interest. Thank you. Thank you Reg! You sure know how to whip up a crowd. Doesn't he? Let's give Reg a hand for his leadership with team NEA!!! I'm honored to be here today and to be in the presence of a group that I admire and respect very much. America's educators are the glue that holds this country together, and it's time that you are given the recognition and praise you deserve. Public education is the backbone of this country, it is what makes America great!! I really like the slogan "Team NEA" because it recognizes the contributions of all of our educational employees and their importance in a strong system of public education. You are the unsung heroes of this country; Whether, you're the teacher in the classroom; The educational support professional that supports our teachers and kids, The bus driver that carries our children to and from school; the cafeteria worker That nourishes them; Or the custodian that ensures our kids are in clean classrooms each of you deserves our Respect, and not just rhetoric, but fair and decent compensation!!! Too often you've been ignored, taken for granted, underpaid, and blamed!!! When I'm President, I promise you ...that will change! I'm Bill Richardson and I'm running for President to bring people together to solve our nation's challenges. I have spent my whole life bringing people together to get things done, as a negotiator, as a Congressman, as a U.N. Ambassador, and most of all as Governor. We broke the partisan gridlock and transformed New Mexico...I was able to get 40% of the Republican vote in a red state. I will use those skills as President, to restore our national standing, Last week, I complained that people always ask howwe are going to pay for education - but they never ask how we are going to pay for the war. I think education is AS or MORE important than anything government does. It was Aristotle twenty three hundred years ago who wrote that the fate of nations depends more on educating youth than any other factor. Not the military. Not the political leadership. Not the economy. America's future will most be determined by how well we educate our kids. We need to get out of Iraq where precious lives and needed dollars have been wasted. We could be using these resources to improve our schools and make the economy -- once again - work for the middle class. In New Mexico I brought back collective bargaining; because I believe in my heart that it is important! Our next President must also improve our country's public education system to ensure that it remains strong and supports our global competitiveness. My record makes me the best prepared to get it done. Candidates have already come here to ask for your support. I know that you are not going to make a decision based on a media profile or fame. You're going to support the person who has always stood with you. You're going to support the person who does more than just talk about making change-but has actually made it happen. I'm proud of what we have achieved for educators, for students, for our families and for all citizens in New Mexico! In New Mexico our Educational Reform Initiative, which is ranked number 2 in the country, is called "Making Schools Work" It has included many factors that have been left out and ignored by the nation's current reform effort: No Child Left Behind! I believe that school reform should improve schools; but our nation's school reform has made our schools look more like Reform Schools with all the mindless testing and bureaucratic rules and regulations!!! I couldn't agree more with the slogan on your convention tee-shirts: "A Child is More than a Test Score." Because it captures the very heart of New Mexico's "Making Schools Work" the well being of children...not the testing corporations.... Who are the heart of this program and I know when you elect me President we can "Make our Nation's Schools Work". Our school improvement agenda recognizes that it is unfair to blame and point the finger at our educators when we have neglected other important factors such as  School readiness Health and nutrition Parental involvement Teacher quality Safe and clean school facilities and access to technologyUnlike the current administration, You and I know better; We know we can't improve our schools with unfunded mandates; And unfair accountability, And punitive sanctions! We have a moral responsibility, to ensure that our educators and our students have the support they need to be successful! It makes me sad to say that public confidence in our public schools has been eroded because of, and I quote, "the soft bigotry of low expectations". While nationally there's been some small improvement in test scores, you have to ask at what cost? In New Mexico there is a wonderful high school in the southeast part of the state. That one high school didn't make AYP because two kids got into a mishap and were unable to take the test. This is unfair, and this is crazy!! Are unfair and crazy things happening in your schools, too? Well, it's got to stop! And I'm committed to bringing fair accountability and support to our schools. Let me tell you my plan for "Making America's Schools Work": First we must focus on Quality Teachers: In New Mexico we raised teachers' salaries and created a three --tiered licensure system. Under this system a beginning teacher can see that in seven years he or she can make a salary of fifty thousand dollars. As a result 94% of our teachers are highly qualified. We've moved from 30th to 17th in teacher quality and our salary rankings have moved from 46th in the nation and are projected to be 29th and we're aiming even higher! As President I would move the country to an average starting salary of $40,000 a year for teachers! Second, it is clear that school readiness is key to children's future educational success. In New Mexico we implemented the Pre-K Act for four year olds. Our program recognizes the importance of addressing the emotional, social, physical, and cognitive development of these young children. We must also fully fund Head Start Programs. Third, we must take action to improve our children's health and nutrition! Our children can't learn if they aren't healthy. In New Mexico we now provide access to free health insurance to every child under the age of five. We have expanded our state immunization program. We've been ranked second and fourth in the nation for nutrition policies and quality of food. We've implemented statewide breakfast programs for our neediest kids. And we've gotten junk food out and put physical education back in. In New Mexico we are Making Schools Work, our PUBLIC SCHOOLS WORK! Let me tell you right now, vouchers are not the answer! I've never supported vouchers and I will NOT SUPPORT VOUCHERS IN THE FUTURE! We were ranked 2nd in the nation for school choice. I support school choice through public charter schools. We have many wonderful charter schools, but to ensure quality education for all of our children they must be held to the same standards of accountability as the rest of our public schools. Parents are critical to Making Our Schools Work not only for New Mexico but for Our nation! You as educators cannot do it alone.We must fund innovative parental involvement and education programs. In New Mexico we've provided every school with an online parental involvement tool kit that provides innovative ways to work with parents. This fall, every elementary school parent will receive a very simple handbook that explicitly tells them how they can support their child's success. You need their support and they need your collaboration. When schools and families work together the child is the winner...and this is what it's all about...our children!! One of the most important tasks facing us today is making sure our schools are preparing our students for the 21st century. Our students need more access to relevant, flexible learning environments via on line learning and greater access to higher education through concurrent and dual enrollment. We must also ensure that our high schools are preparing more math and science students and I will fight for the creation of new math and science academies across the country...and i'll make sure that girls and children of color know they're welcome there as well. Let me close with what's at the foremost in your mind...No Child Left Behind...The Act has a noble goal but has been implemented unfairly, and is still under-funded... It can be improved It must be improved And when I'm elected it will be improved, or it will be abolished!!!!!! Now don't get me wrong, I'm not against accountability, but I believe in accountability when it is fair and when schools' are funded and given the support they need. President Bush promised to be the education President. But like many other promises and things this administration has said it was going to do, after the photo-ops -- the policy got stuck in a drawer and forgotten. Well, we can't afford to forget our children. In the interest of time here's the short list of the many issues that need to be addressed:  Get rid of the pass/fail model of AYP Provide a more meaningful and honest picture of a school that utilizes more than a single test score  Use fairer tests and realistic timelines for our English Language Learners and Special Education Students Provide more funding to help our students succeed. For example: extending the school year, or extending the school day Provide financial incentives for districts to attract high quality teachers to schools of highest needs, not only in cities, but suburban and rural areasHere's the bottom line, I'm not an educator, you are! I'm not in the classroom everyday with kids, you are! I'm not the expert, you are! For that reason, when you elect me president I will create a blue ribbon panel for educational excellence and I promise that NEA members will be represented on this panel. In New Mexico, NEA was at the table when we created Making Schools Work! I believe we need to create educational policy from the bottom up, not the top down! It needs to be created from those whose hearts and souls are committed to quality education for all our children...from those who are committed to public education....that is you, and that is me. Very few things motivate me more to want to be President of the United States than a chance to make a difference in the lives of our kids. And together we can make public education strong...you'll hear from presidential candidates who want you on their team. But you need to ask yourself three things:  Who has been there for me in the past? Who will be there for me in the future? And who has the skill to bring this country together, and not drive us apart?For the answer to those questions; just look at my record. I got it done, and I will get it done. But I'm going to need your help to do it! Thank you, God Bless you, and all of our educators, God Bless our System of Public Education, and God Bless the United States! It is a pleasure to be in New Hampshire to announce our national platform for women. Women in New Hampshire have always led the way politically. Women like Carol Shea Porter, Terri Norelli, Linda Foster, Representative Tara Reardon and Amanda Grady, Policy Director for the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. I'm proud to say that Representative Reardon and Director Grady are both members of the Women for Richardson Steering Committee.But our platform is not just for the women of New Hampshire - it is for women nationwide. Women like my Education Secretary Dr. Veronica Garcia, and my Women's Health Advisor Giovanna Rossi -- also members of my steering committee. Let me also take a moment to acknowledge the Co-Chairs of my Women for Richardson Steering Committee. Lt. Governor Diane Denish -- who couldn't be here today because I left her in charge of New Mexico -- and Dr. Martha Burk. Thank you very much for all you have done for my campaign.Let me begin by saying that women are not a "special interest" as they are so often called by the media. Women are the majority. And we are here to address the concerns of that majority.I am very proud of the things I have done as Governor of New Mexico to address the concerns and promote the interests of women.In my administration we have dramatically increased penalties for domestic violence and nearly tripled funding for shelters so women and children get the protection they need. I am the first New Mexico governor to appoint a women's health advisor, Giovanna Rossi who as I mentioned is here today, and I created the first ever Governor's Women's Health Advisory Council, whose mission it is to create an environment in which every woman and girl will experience optimal health and well-being. In New Mexico under my administration we have raised our teachers' salaries, expanded the number of children enrolled in our Pre-Kindergarten program for four-year-olds from 2,200 to 3,800, and funded after-school enrichment programs.I have always appointed women to critical positions -- not out of a sense of duty or to fill a quota, but because they were the most qualified. As Secretary of the Department of Energy, my appointments were two thirds female and minority. I presently have 12 outstanding and extremely qualified female cabinet secretaries, and I am proud to have run now worked closely with for five years Lt. Governor Diane Denish, the first female Lt. Governor in New Mexico's history. As President, I will not only continue the commitment I have made to women's concerns in New Mexico, I will go farther than any other candidate to support women and their families.ENDING THE WAR First, we know that the number one concern of women going into the last election was ending the war, and women in New Hampshire and all across the country tell me every day that it is still a top concern. I am the ONLY candidate that has promised to bring home ALL of our troops now.PAY EQUITY I also know that pay equity is something women worry about every day. Women like Lilly Ledbetter, who for 20 years worked alongside men being paid more than her, and was told by the Supreme Court last month that she had no case.I support the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act now before Congress, and I also support the Paycheck Fairness Act which would beef up enforcement of our existing laws.But these measures do not go far enough. You know, employers have the right to know everything about you – your family situation, your medical history, even whether you've ever had a parking ticket. Yet women cannot learn even the most basic information about the employer's pay practices.Much of the inequality would be eliminated if employers reported pay statistics by job classification, gender, and race. Not anybody's salary on a bulletin board, but simple anonymous statistics. That way employees would know if they were being treated fairly, and employers could see if they had a problem that needed correcting. I am the ONLY candidate to call for this kind of basic, sensible and fair information.Paid Family LeaveLet me also say that working women and men should not have to choose between their jobs and their families in time of need. When I was in Congress I voted for the Family and Medical Leave Act -- it was a great step forward. But we need to do more. We should expand this law by including paid family leave for births and adoptions, or caregiving for elderly parents.There's a bipartisan bill, sponsored by Senators Dodd and Stevens, that would create an insurance fund allowing workers and their employers to share the costs and benefits of paid family leave. The bill is good for business because it will save enormous amounts of money in turnover and replacement costs, and it helps working families by granting a much needed benefit at a small shared cost.This is the kind of innovative policy we've been working on in New Mexico -- good for business, good for the economy and good for families.SOCIAL SECURITY Working women are not my only concern. The largest group of elderly American living in poverty are retired women on Social Securit. Many of those women have low benefits because they took time out of the work force to care for children or elderly parents. And for every year they performed that vital function for society, they got a zero in their Social Security account.That is wrong and as President, I will work to change that. Caregivers deserve more than lip service for the work they do. Our retirement system should recognize this valuable work by awarding Social Security credit at least as high as the minimum wage. I am the ONLY candidate to call for a caregiver credit in Social Security.RIGHT TO CHOOSE And I want to protect the rights and health of our younger women too. The right to control their own reproductive choices, and the right to medical privacy.I am the ONLY candidate to explicitly commit to protecting Roe v. Wade through appointing ONLY Supreme Court justices who recognize it as settled law.Some people call this a "litmus test." I call it respecting precedent and putting women's lives above politics.The United States should end the global gag rule on family planning and restore funding for women's health research here in the United States.EDUCATIONWe must also make sure our young girls are getting all the educational chances they deserve. We must protect Title IX and our girls' educational opportunities. I would also create 250 Math and Science academies across the country, and I will make sure our young girls know they're welcome there. I'll also do what we're working on in New Mexico, and establish a federal Pre-K program that helps every state offer voluntary pre-kindergarten for every 4-year-old child.CONCLUSION: EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT And finally, there is one very big thing that our previous president's have talked about, but have not done anything about. And that is the Equal Rights Amendment. We have an Equal Rights Amendment in New Mexico, and I am very proud of that.Many of the problems I have talked about today would go away if women had simple equality in our constitution. It's fair, it's sensible, it's American. I pledge as President to work for that equality, to make it a priority, so that women, the majority, will have equal status in our society once and for all. Nearly six years ago, 19 Al Qaeda terrorists committed the largest mass murder in our country's history. Now, more than 2000 days later, those who organized 9-11 hide along the Pakistan/Afghanistan border. Our intelligence agencies tell us that Al Qaeda today is more diffuse and dangerous than ever. Al Qaeda is not the only terrorist group. But it is unique -- it has declared war on America, it has attacked us on our soil -- and it continues to plan another spectacular domestic attack like 9-11 or worse. The leaders of Al Qaeda say they wish to kill 4 million Americans, including 2 million children. In their madness, they claim that such a slaughter of innocents would "balance the scales of justice," for crimes that they allege we have committed against Muslims. We would be mad not to take them at their word. So I want to focus my comments today on what we need to do to defeat Al Qaeda. That is not to ignore other groups. Indeed much of what we do to destroy Al Qaeda will help defeat other terrorists. Rather, it is to recognize what this Administration seems never to have understood: the unique danger posed to our country by Al Qaeda and its sympathizers. Al Qaeda first attacked America in 1998 in East Africa. Months before that attack, President Clinton sent me to Afghanistan to press the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden. They refused. So we imposed tough UN sanctions on them. When the Bush Administration came into office they seemed not to understand how serious the threat we faced was. They ignored dire warnings from the CIA and other terrorist experts. The August 6, 2001 Presidential daily briefing read "Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US." The President failed to understand what this meant. After September 11th, he seemed finally to get it. I supported the liberation of Afghanistan. I had seen with my own eyes the Taliban's repression of women; their paranoid intolerance of all dissent and all diversity. I knew they were unlikely to respond to reason. If only the President had kept his eye on the ball and finished the job when he had the chance. Al Qaeda was on the ropes in 2002, cornered in the badlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan. If our troops had been given the resources they needed, we could have finished them off. But the President chose instead to divert our resources from that necessary war to a war of choice. We know that there was no Al Qaeda in Iraq before 2001 and no Iraqi connection to 9-11. Extensive study by the 9-11 commission and others has confirmed that. Even the President admits it. And we know now that Iraq had no WMD. Iraq diverted critical intelligence and military resources from the fight against Al Qaeda. We let up the pressure and Al Qaeda recovered -- and struck back. Since 2002, Al Qaeda and its affiliates have carried out attacks in Algiers, Casablanca, Madrid, London, Istanbul, Riyadh, Tel Aviv, Jeddah, Karachi, Sharm al Shaykh, Taba, Mombassa, Kuwait, Mumbai, New Delhi, Dacca, Bali and elsewhere. In Iraq, the President rejected the sage advice of those who argued that we needed a careful plan for what to do after we reached Baghdad. Mr. Bush did not have a plan. But Al Qaeda did. After the US invasion, it sent fighters to Iraq with the goal of provoking a civil war. It carried out hundreds of attacks on Shia shrines, leaders and innocents to provoke the sectarian bloodbath we face today. It was an evil plan -- but a predictable one. But, lost in his delusions of an easy peace, President Bush did not figure out what was happening until it was too late. Iraq was now in a civil war, and there was nothing we could do to stop it. So the result today is an Al Qaeda which is more diffuse and more deadly than ever. It has a stronghold in South Asia and a booming franchise in Iraq. It is raising so much money in Iraq that it cannot spend it all there -- and it uses it to fund other operations around the world. And sooner or later Al Qaeda will attack America at home again. We have already foiled plots to do so. We know that they take their time, and slowly and methodically plan and then execute spectacular attacks. We know they have tried to acquire nuclear weapons. Our FBI Director says he stays up at night worrying about an Al Qaeda nuclear attack on America. We need to address this threat with the focus it deserves. We need a grand strategy for defeating Al Qaeda. The past five years have demonstrated that a primarily military strategy will not work. Indeed, the botched occupation of Iraq has played into the hands of the Jihadists -- bolstering their propaganda that the US wants to kill Muslims, and that we want to control the Muslim world to exploit its resources. Never has America been as unpopular as it is today. In Iraq, and in many other Muslim countries, polls show that our credibility has plummeted. As a direct result of the Iraq occupation, large majorities of Muslims now say they distrust America. Such sentiment facilitates Jihadist recruitment and boosts their popular support. A new grand strategy against the Qaeda movement must repair this damage that the Bush policies have done to our international reputation. In particular, we need to reach out to Muslims, and demonstrate -- by our actions as well as our words -- that we respect Muslim culture and value Muslim life. We need to earn back our allies' confidence in American leadership, and diplomatically resolve the conflicts that fuel Al Qaeda's recruitment in the Muslim world. We must overcome those who call for the destruction of Israel, and achieve a just, two-state solution which guarantees Israel's security. Intelligence efforts need to focus on the Al Qaeda leadership, and on breaking up cells before they act. This will require more human intelligence and more Arab-speaking experts, as well as better intelligence coordination with our allies and Arab friends. The target of our military strategy needs to be the Al Qaeda leadership. As long as these men are active, they symbolize the success of resistance to America, and attract new recruits. It is not good enough to have them "hiding in caves." The death or capture of Osama bin Ladin and his associates in Pakistan and Afghanistan will not end the Al Qaeda movement, but it will deal it a serious setback. So how do we do it? A critical first step is to enhance our commitment -- military, political and economic -- to Afghanistan. To defeat the resurgent Taliban will require a significant increase in NATO forces along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border-- and that will require American leadership. We urgently must redirect our military effort away from Iraq (where Al Qaeda's leadership is not located) and toward the Afghanistan-Pakistan border (where they ARE located). When our allies see that we have finally gotten our priorities straight -- that we have revived our commitment to going after the Al Qaeda leadership where it is -- only then will they provide enough troops and equipment to overwhelm the enemy. It is also critical that we engage Muslim countries in this effort: to the extent that the troops rooting out Al Qaeda and the Taliban are Muslims, the Jihadists cannot portray the effort to defeat them as one of "the West against Islam." The US therefore should encourage our Muslim and Arab partners, especially Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, to offer troops to help stabilize Afghanistan. NATO should create a contact group, led by a senior NATO diplomat, to engage all of Afghanistan's neighbors on border stabilization, especially along the 1500 mile long Pakistan border. This group should include Iran and India. We need a much bigger economic reconstruction program for Afghanistan. Humanitarian and economic aid fosters goodwill and bolsters support for our efforts. Nothing is more effective against our enemies than the memory of American aid workers who saved a child or rebuilt a village after an earthquake or a Tsunami. Saving Afghanistan will require a multilateral Marshall Plan -- an effort on the scale of what rebuilt Europe after the Second World War. The US should lead a coalition to rebuild this country that has been ravaged by three decades of war. Russia, Japan, Europe, India and others should contribute. Such a Marshall Plan must include a program to provide all Afghan children with education and free lunches. Too many children fall into the hands of Islamic schools, some of which teach violence, because it is their only educational option. The long-term defeat of Al Qaeda depends on teaching hope, rather than hate, to the next generation. These efforts also must extend into Pakistan. The border regions are poverty-stricken breeding grounds for Jihadism. We need to read the riot act to Dick Cheney's pal, President Musharraf. We have provided him with $10 billion, in mostly military aid. Future aid must be linked to a real crackdown on terrorists -- including Arabs, Afghans and Kashmiris. Musharraf also doesn't seem to care much for democracy. We need to insist that Pakistan have free elections this year. Some have argued that democracy could bring radical Islamists to power. That is nonsense. Polls show that most Pakistanis favor the mainstream parties. However, the narrow political base of the Musharraf government is a key reason why the Taliban and Al Qaeda are growing in influence. Pakistan needs a representative government and a free and vibrant civil society, if it is to resist the Siren's call of the Jihadists. Iraq is also a critical battlefield in the fight against Jihadism -- because it prevents us from fully engaging the core Al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Our enemies want us to remain bogged down in Iraq. Let me say that again -- Al Qaeda benefits from our being trapped in Iraq, and wants us to stay there. They know that if we were not stuck in Iraq, we could go after them where they are. They know that the Shia and the Kurds in Iraq don't want them there, and that many Sunni Iraqis tolerate them only because they are allies against us. When we leave, they know the Iraqis will drive them out of Iraq. We cannot defeat Al Qaeda until we get out of Iraq. An orderly, phased and complete troop withdrawal could be completed rapidly -- and it is imperative that it be complete. The key to an exit strategy is to exit. We don't need a South Korea-like solution as the President suggests, an open-ended military base in Iraq that will alienate succeeding generations of Iraqis and other Muslims. This Monday Sandy Berger and Bruce Riedel wrote an op-ed in the Financial Times that endorses this position. They wrote, "A clear U.S. commitment to a complete, irreversible withdrawal from Iraq may now be the only way to develop a regional concert of powers that could work with Iraqis to try to stabilize the country and cauterize the conflict." More and more are agreeing with me. We must remove ALL of our troops. I hope Congress will de-authorize this war and force President Bush to start bringing them out this year. The sooner we are out of Iraq, the sooner we can begin to win the real war against the real terrorists who attacked this country on 9-11. We cannot win the war against Al Qaeda alone. It is urgent that we rebuild our alliances, so that we can once again lead other nations. Trust is critical to getting allies to work with us in the secret world of counter terrorism and in the open world of public diplomacy. This administration has driven away our allies with swagger and saber rattling. I will rebuild our alliances by making common cause with partners who share our values and interests. We also need to win the war of ideas with Al Qaeda. Simply calling for democracy is not enough, because actions speak louder than words. And the actions of the Bush administration have not matched its rhetoric. Military tactics which have resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians have fed the perception -- fanned by the Jihadists' propaganda -- that we don't care about Muslim life. Human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and elsewhere have sullied our reputation. When people see these images, they associate America not with human rights and freedom, but rather with secret prisons and torture. America is better than the Bush-Cheney administration. If we want to win the war of ideas, we need to return to our proud tradition as a country that respects human rights. I have spoken before of the ideological war that is going on in the Islamic world today between fanatics like bin Laden and moderates like Jordan's King Abdullah and Morocco's King Muhammad, who have a progressive view of Islam. We need to stand by these leaders in their effort to defeat extremism. As President I will personally engage in a new Middle East peace process, and I will make achieving a two-state solution my highest diplomatic priority. President Clinton came very close to a deal in 2000, and the Bush administration's disengagement for six years allowed the situation to drift and degenerate. To reverse this damage, as President I would appoint a full-time high-level envoy dedicated to improving our relationships with the Muslim world. This person would be fluent in the cultures, language and customs of the Arab Street, and serve as an attaché helping to bridge the divide the Bush Administration's failed policies have helped to create. The President should also use our enhanced relationship with India in the wake of the nuclear deal signed last year to encourage the nascent Indo-Pakistani dialogue. Kashmir is key to breaking the Pakistani connection to terror. I have been to Islamabad and I have listened to Pakistani leaders plead with America to do something about Kashmir. It is a cause which fuels resentment of the West in their country, and pushes people to support terrorists. The time for preventive diplomacy on the subcontinent is now, while Pakistan and India are talking to each other. HOMELAND SECURITY We also must address homeland security much more strategically than we have. A biological or nuclear attack could be as horrific as Hiroshima -- and terrorism experts agree that sooner or later such an attack is likely. We must do everything we can to prevent this -- and we must improve our ability to respond quickly if an attack occurs, to assist the victims, and to recover. A strong civil defense system is essential not just to save lives after an attack, but also to help prevent attacks. That is because, to the extent that we can survive and rebuild, rather than panic, the attack loses some of its military value to the terrorists. This is what experts call "resilience." Accordingly, we must remember that civil defense measures are not just playing defense. They are essential components of a grand strategy to defeat Al Qaeda. State and local governments have roles to play in homeland security. In New Mexico we have taken many steps to make our citizens more secure. We passed a statewide mutual aid law so that communities can assist one another without bureaucratic red tape, and we made Emergency Management and Homeland Security an independent, cabinet-level department. We also established a robust border security program, and established a funding stream to help border communities police more effectively. We passed a law providing job protection to volunteer emergency responders, and we increased supplemental life insurance for our National Guard. But protecting American citizens from terrorist attack is fundamentally the responsibility of the federal government. Only the federal government can protect our borders and our ports, fund cutting-edge technologies, and undertake many other functions that need to be done at the national and international levels. While the Bush administration has taken some measures to improve security, particularly of air travel, there are many things which -- nearly six years after 9-11 -- have not been done to protect the American people. By far, the most urgent thing we must do -- and are not doing -- is to vastly improve the surge capacity of our public health systems, so that we can respond quickly and effectively to a nuclear or biological attack. This administration has neglected to fund the modernization of our ability to take care of Americans and to recover from an attack at home. We must reverse this. We should build mobile hospitals that can be brought quickly wherever they are needed, and we should stockpile equipment, medicines and vaccines, and equip standby hospitals. The Federal government needs to provide funding so that every community has an effective disaster management system, as well as reliable communications systems among all first responders and medical facilities. And we urgently must train more doctors, paramedics and, especially, nurses for disaster and terrorism response. Such personnel, of course, can also help improve health care delivery every day to underserved populations. The Federal Government can make this happen with a medical GI bill -- a scholarship program for nurses and other medical specialists. A medical GI bill would provide full scholarships in exchange for a commitment to serve in poor and rural areas, and to participate in national disaster response. We need to be able to produce large amounts of vaccine for new diseases -- quickly. Flu vaccines are still manufactured the same way they have been for decades, using eggs, and must be made for specific strains of disease. The Federal government can help with more funding for cell-based vaccine manufacture and recombinant DNA vaccines. We also need risk-based funding for homeland security: it is unpatriotic for legislators to turn homeland security dollars into pork. We need to spend homeland security funds where they are needed -- in high-risk urban areas like New York, Chicago, and LA. We know Al Qaeda has sought nuclear weapons, and that if they obtain them they will use them with the same ruthlessness with which they flew airplanes filled with people into buildings filled with people. I have spoken at length elsewhere about how to prevent this "ultimate preventable catastrophe." Preventing a terrorist nuclear attack requires urgent action on many fronts: First and foremost, we must keep nuclear materials out of the hands of terrorists, both through counter-proliferation, and by securing all fissionable material worldwide. This is a huge task, but not an impossible one. The United States must lead a comprehensive global effort to secure all nuclear weapons and all nuclear fuel and spent fuel. This is the only way to keep nukes out of the wrong hands. Good things already have been done, such as the Nunn-Lugar program and DOE's Material Protection, Control and Accounting program. But we must do more to secure nuclear arsenals, above all those of Russia and Pakistan. Now that we are finally talking to the North Koreans, we need to make sure that they desist from trafficking and that they really dismantle their nukes. And we must not relent in leading international efforts to stop Iran's nuclear enrichment program -- with diplomacy combining tough sanctions and positive incentives. And we need a global fuel-banking arrangement that insures that nuclear fuel is enriched and spent-fuel is disposed of in a limited number of highly-secure sites. Such a comprehensive and global diplomatic effort to secure the nuclear materials Al Qaeda wants must be a top priority of the next President. As a former Energy Secretary, I understand the urgency of this. As a diplomat and former US Ambassador to the UN, I believe we can do it. We also need to prevent nuclear weapons from getting past our borders -- not with walls, but with vastly improved detection efforts on the Canadian and Mexican borders, at our sea and land ports, and on the high seas. This will take major investments in technology, intelligence gathering and personnel, including National Guard and border security. But it is needed to interdict nuclear weapons or materials terrorists will try to smuggle into the country. America can and will defeat Al Qaeda. Because at the end of the day the vast majority of Muslims do not share their twisted vision of jihad. And with the right American leadership, the world will follow us as we put these people out of business. We need leadership that understands the nature of the enemy, and focuses on the real terrorists who attacked us on 9-11. Leadership that recognizes that we must lead by example, that our deeds must match our words, and that we are strongest -- and safest -- when we use ALL of our resource -- military, economic, diplomatic, humanitarian and political. With this kind of leadership, and with a comprehensive global strategy, we can and will defeat Al Qaeda. Thank you. Thanks so much for that kind introduction. It's all true. It's an honor for me to be here in Iowa today. And I want to thank you for joining me in this national discussion about our healthcare system. Affordable health coverage is a fading dream for many families -- families who all too often are waking to the nightmare of a sick child or parent. These are the facts. Over 45 million of our fellow Americans do not have health insurance. Since 2000, health care premiums for families have nearly doubled. By some estimates, 18,000 American lives are lost each year because of inadequate health insurance. We need universal healthcare now. Despite Republican hand-wringing about the cost of universal care, it is clear that the cost of doing something -- in lives and dollars -- pales in comparison to the cost of doing nothing. We cannot afford a healthcare system that doesn't cover every American. The cost to our economy and the well-being of our people is just too high. Today, we as a nation need to be responsible stewards of the health of our children and parents, our brothers and sisters, our husbands and wives. President Bush has failed this basic test of American decency. The response of the Bush Administration to the healthcare crisis has been predictably perverse. Not content to sit back and do nothing, President Bush is now threatening to veto the S-CHIP legislation, which would effectively force states to drop coverage for up to a million children. Let's be clear: right now, President Bush's health care plan is to eliminate the health coverage of nearly a million children. That's not policy, it's punishment. We need a government that makes it easier, not harder, to keep our kids healthy. We need a President who believes that every American should have access to quality healthcare. Every American. Period. But we should also remember that good intentions are not a policy. We need a common-sense, American solution to this American problem. We need a system that works. My plan is built on common-sense principles. We have to remember the virtue of personal responsibility, but we cannot forget we're all in this together. We need to recognize that choice is good, but only if there are good choices for everyone. I believe that your health and the health of your loved ones should not depend on your station in life. All Americans deserve quality healthcare, whether you're a ditchdigger or a CEO, or a bus driver or a teacher, or a doctor. Even the rich suffer the poverty of sickness. Cancer and diabetes don't ask for bank statements before they strike. And so, first, we guarantee coverage for all Americans. The path to universal health coverage will not be easy, but it is both the right and righteous thing to do. Universal healthcare is not only a moral imperative, it is also an economic imperative. The lack of guaranteed, quality healthcare coverage costs us up to 130 billion dollars each year in lost productivity. By 2010 the average family that does have insurance will pay an extra 15 hundred dollars to cover those that don't. COVERAGE My plan builds on existing models to rapidly expand coverage. My plan does not build new bureaucracy. The last thing we need between patients and doctors is another sticky web of red tape. And we don't need a one-size-fits-all system -- Americans deserve better than that. My plan offers five effective options for delivering quality coverage: plans for veterans, lower-income children and families, young adults, Americans 55 to 64, and working families and small businesses.Some of my colleagues in Washington seem to have forgotten that working families and small businesses -- not politicians -- are the engine that makes our economy work. We need a healthcare system that works for them. And when I am elected, they will be able to purchase the same plan that members of Congress and the President have. Under my plan, we will expand Medicare as a choice for Americans 55 to 64. This is just plain common sense. New research from the New England Journal of Medicine shows that this could reduce costs by ensuring that older adults get the cancer screening and other preventive services that they need. It's about time that this Great Society program reached more of our society's members. Young adults up to age twenty-five will be given the option of keeping their family coverage regardless of student status. Too many young people are left excluded and vulnerable as they transition into adulthood. Our young people are too valuable a resource to leave unprotected. With my plan, lower-income children and families will obtain coverage through expanded Medicaid and S-CHIP programs. And my plan doesn't forget about the well-being of our nation's veterans. Our veterans are not asking for the parades or honors they've earned so many times over -- they're simply asking for the same decent medical coverage that so many of us civilians take for granted. And, they shouldn't have to ask. That's why I will create a Heroes Health Card that provides veterans with the care they deserve, where they need it, without bureaucratic hassles. At the same time, we will strengthen the VA system by guaranteeing funding from year to year, so that they can directly access the high-quality care they were promised. These men and women fought the enemy abroad. They should not have to fight their government at home to get the health care they need. COST My vision of American healthcare begins with individual choice and shared responsibility. To ensure that every American gets quality coverage, we need to ensure that every American has a stake in the system. Therefore, by the end of my first term, my plan will require that all Americans obtain coverage for themselves and their families. All Americans will be responsible for their fair share. Employers will be required to contribute to their employees' healthcare premiums, or pay to help the uninsured purchase coverage. Make no mistake, we are going to pay for this, one way or another. We are paying hundreds of Billions for the uninsured now -- people who delay and skip the care they need wind up in emergency rooms and have the costs of their chronic diseases spiral unnecessarily out of control. My plan fairly distributes the cost and will dramatically reduce the expenses we are already paying. Insurance companies have to be part of the healthcare solution, not part of the problem. We will require these companies to insure anyone who wants coverage, instead of cherry-picking the healthiest of our citizens. If only the healthy needed health insurance, we wouldn't have a problem. I believe that everyone deserves coverage regardless of health or financial status. We are building a national house of healthcare, and we cannot afford to turn any Americans away. We must also recognize that available coverage is meaningless unless it's affordable. Americans who need help paying for coverage will get a sliding-scale tax credit to help out. Many families are forced to charge medical expenses to their credit cards -- often resulting in outrageous interest rates that quickly spiral out of control. American households with a major medical expense in the past three years have an average of almost $4,000 more credit-card debt. I will set limits on the interest rates that can be imposed on medical expenses charged to credit cards. It is simply wrong for credit-card companies to exploit the illness and misfortune of families, and we will stop this practice. CONTROLLING COSTS -- OVERALL  Just as important as helping some afford health coverage, is making sure that healthcare costs are lower for all. We spend 2.2 trillion dollars a year on health care in this country. 2.2 trillion dollars. We all know that we're not getting what we've paid for. First of all, we spend too much on bureaucracy -- up to 31 percent of national health care expenditures go towards administration. We need more doctors treating patients and fewer bureaucrats pushing paper. How do we do that? I would require insurance companies to spend less on administration and at least 85% on direct care; I would standardize their forms; and I would simplify reporting requirements for physicians and hospitals. Right now, there are nearly thirty federal agencies involved in regulating hospitals, not to mention state, local and private organizations. We can do better. In addition, we could save almost 160 billion dollars every year by improving our health information technology. This is a modern problem and we need to use modern tools to fix it. I would allow Medicare to negotiate directly for prescription drugs. Perhaps most importantly, we need to drastically shift our focus from the endgame to the pre-game. That means serious investment in prevention. A wise man once said that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of the cure." But I doubt even he imagined that our federal government would spend 80 billion dollars per year to treat diabetes, but only four billion to prevent and manage the disease. That just doesn't make sense. We need to require that all health plans cover a standard set of proven preventive services. If there's one thing better than a patient's being cured of a disease, it's his never having had it at all. As President, I will help communities get junk food out of their schools and physical education back in -- just like we've done in New Mexico. I would also sign a nationwide smoking ban in workplaces, as I have in New Mexico. Smoking causes over four hundred thousand deaths per year and costs us at least 157 billion dollars. We cannot claim to be serious about public health unless we are serious about getting smoking out of public places. QUALITY OF CARE Finally, we need to improve quality of care. It's the right thing to do for our people and for our economy. Medicare alone could save nearly 40 billion dollars a year -- while improving patient outcomes -- if everybody in the program got the highest-quality, most-efficient care. There are six common-sense steps we can take to improve care: First, I will ensure that health care providers have the tools they need. These include electronic medical records and reimbursement for providing proven preventive care. These tools are just as important to improving care as stethoscopes and syringes. Second, I will promote evidence-based care. I will form a public-private partnership to research the comparative effectiveness of new drugs, devices, tests and treatments. Again, this is simple common sense. Treatment should be determined by rational research, not by the size of an advertising budget. Third, I will improve patient safety. We have to expand training programs; require healthcare facilities to report preventable errors; and support hospitals that are working to improve patient safety and prevent avoidable hospitalizations. Preventable medical errors cost our nation up to 29 billion dollars and 100,000 lives every year. Fourth, we need to expand our healthcare workforce, including more primary care providers. We need to recruit and train an army of doctors and nurses to fight off the scourge of sickness. I'd expand incentives to encourage primary care and rural physicians through an expanded training and scholarship program. Fifth, I will promote chronic disease and mental health management. State-of-the-art programs provided to VA and Medicare patients with severe chronic diseases have already achieved dramatic results -- including a 60% reduction in hospitalizations among patients with chronic heart failure I will continue to champion full parity between mental health and physical health benefits in all health plans. And I will promote better mental health care by supporting the formation of integrated primary care teams that include primary care and mental health providers. Expanding these programs and this approach could dramatically improve quality of life, reduce avoidable hospitalizations, and save tens of billions of dollars per year.And sixth, I would reduce healthcare disparities based on race and ethnicity. These disparities are simply unacceptable and un-American. By expanding insurance and outreach to underinsured minority groups -- we can address such disparities in AIDS, diabetes and other diseases. Today, I have tried to lay out the principles, objectives, and detailed methods that I think should guide healthcare in America. My plan provides choices -- including the choice to keep your current coverage -- and existing programs to expand coverage options. We reduce the costs of healthcare for all and we pay for universal coverage by creating savings, not raising taxes. We reduce bureaucracy and administration and invest in quality of care. As with any worthwhile investment, my plan will require capital up front -- about 110 billion dollars per year. By making healthcare more coordinated, safe, and efficient; by investing in health information technology; and by spending what we have wisely in the ways I have described, my plan will save us up to 110 billion dollars every year…. So -- this is a fiscally responsible plan. I'm a Governor -- I am required to balance my state's budget. I have done that five times while expanding access to health care and making hundreds of millions in new health care investments for New Mexico families. We cannot afford a healthcare system that doesn't cover every American. And we cannot afford to wait any longer. Now is the time. For the forty-five million uninsured who have suffered the loneliness of indifference -- now is the time. For the hard-working Americans strangled by the cost of care -- now is the time. For the wounded veterans who have served their nation honorably -- now is the time. For every daughter who has watched her mother slowly pass from a treatable disease; for every father who lies awake at night because he can't afford his son's insurance -- now is the time. For every American who wants to look a suffering loved one in the eye and tell them that tomorrow will be better than today -- now is the time. For the good of our nation, now must be the time. Thank you. Thank you for that great introduction. I'm honored to be here today and to be in the presence of a group that I admire and respect very much. America's educators are the glue that holds this country together, and it's time that you are given the recognition and praise you deserve. Public education is the backbone of this country, it is what makes america great!! I really like the slogan "Team NEA" because it recognizes the contributions of all of our educational employees and their importance in a strong system of public education. You are the unsung heroes of this country; Whether, you're the teacher in the classroom; The educational support professional that supports our teachers and kids, The bus driver that carries our children to and from school; the cafeteria worker That nourishes them; Or the custodian that ensures our kids are in clean classrooms each of you deserves our Respect, and not just rhetoric, but fair and decent compensation!!! Too often you've been ignored, taken for granted, underpaid, and blamed!!! When I'm President, I promise you …that will change! I'm Bill Richardson and I'm running for President to bring people together to solve our nation's challenges. I have spent my whole life bringing people together to get things done, as a negotiator, as a Congressman, as a U.N. Ambassador, and most of all as Governor. We broke the partisan gridlock and transformed New Mexico…I was able to get 40% of the Republican vote in a red state. I will use those skills as President, to restore our national standing, Last week, I complained that people always ask howwe are going to pay for education - but they never ask how we are going to pay for the war. I think education is AS or MORE important than anything government does. It was Aristotle twenty three hundred years ago who wrote that the fate of nations depends more on educating youth than any other factor. Not the military. Not the political leadership. Not the economy. America's future will most be determined by how well we educate our kids. We need to get out of Iraq where precious lives and needed dollars have been wasted. We could be using these resources to improve our schools and make the economy -- once again - work for the middle class. In New Mexico I brought back collective bargaining; because I believe in my heart that it is important! Our next President must also improve our country's public education system to ensure that it remains strong and supports our global competitiveness. My record makes me the best prepared to get it done. Candidates have already come here to ask for your support. I know that you are not going to make a decision based on a media profile or fame. You're going to support the person who has always stood with you. You're going to support the person who does more than just talk about making change-but has actually made it happen. I'm proud of what we have achieved for educators, for students, for our families and for all citizens in New Mexico! In New Mexico our Educational Reform Initiative, which is ranked number 2 in the country, is called "Making Schools Work" It has included many factors that have been left out and ignored by the nation's current reform effort: No Child Left Behind! I believe that school reform should improve schools; but our nation's school reform has made our schools look more like Reform Schools with all the mindless testing and bureaucratic rules and regulations!!! I couldn't agree more with the slogan: "A Child is More than a Test Score." Because it captures the very heart of New Mexico's "Making Schools Work" the well being of children…not the testing corporations…. who are the heart of this program and I know when you elect me President we can "Make our Nation's Schools Work". Our school improvement agenda recognizes that it is unfair to blame and point the finger at our educators when we have neglected other important factors such as  School readiness Health and nutrition Parental involvement Teacher quality Safe and clean school facilities and access to technology  Unlike the current administration, You and I know better; We know we can't improve our schools with unfunded mandates; And unfair accountability, And punitive sanctions! We have a moral responsibility, to ensure that our educators and our students have the support they need to be successful! It makes me sad to say that public confidence in our public schools has been eroded because of, and I quote, "the soft bigotry of low expectations". While nationally there's been some small improvement in test scores, you have to ask at what cost? In New Mexico there is a wonderful high school in the southeast part of the state. That one high school didn't make AYP because two kids got into a mishap and were unable to take the test. This is unfair, and this is crazy!! Are unfair and crazy things happening in your schools, too? Well, it's got to stop! And I'm committed to bringing fair accountability and support to our schools. Let me tell you my plan for "Making America's Schools Work": First we must focus on Quality Teachers: In New Mexico we raised teachers' salaries and created a three --tiered licensure system. Under this system a beginning teacher can see that in seven years he or she can make a salary of fifty thousand dollars. As a result 94% of our teachers are highly qualified. We've moved from 30th to 17th in teacher quality and our salary rankings have moved from 46th in the nation and are projected to be 29th and we're aiming even higher! As President I would move the country to an average starting salary of $40,000 a year for teachers! Second, it is clear that school readiness is key to children's future educational success. In New Mexico we implemented the Pre-K Act for four year olds. Our program recognizes the importance of addressing the emotional, social, physical, and cognitive development of these young children. We must also fully fund Head Start Programs. Third, we must take action to improve our children's health and nutrition! Our children can't learn if they aren't healthy. In New Mexico we now provide access to free health insurance to every child under the age of five. We have expanded our state immunization program. We've been ranked second and fourth in the nation for nutrition policies and quality of food. We've implemented statewide breakfast programs for our neediest kids. And we've gotten junk food out and put physical education back in. In New Mexico we are Making Schools Work, our public schools work! Let me tell you right now, vouchers are not the answer! I've never supported vouchers and I will not support vouchers in the future! We were ranked 2nd in the nation for school choice. I support school choice through public charter schools. We have many wonderful charter schools, but to ensure quality education for all of our children they must be held to the same standards of accountability as the rest of our public schools. Parents are critical to Making Our Schools Work not only for New Mexico but for Our nation! You as educators cannot do it alone.We must fund innovative parental involvement and education programs. In New Mexico we've provided every school with an online parental involvement tool kit that provides innovative ways to work with parents. This fall, every elementary school parent will receive a very simple handbook that explicitly tells them how they can support their child's success. You need their support and they need your collaboration. When schools and families work together the child is the winner…and this is what it's all about…our children!! One of the most important tasks facing us today is making sure our schools are preparing our students for the 21st century. Our students need more access to relevant, flexible learning environments via on line learning and greater access to higher education through concurrent and dual enrollment. We must also ensure that our high schools are preparing more math and science students and I will fight for the creation of new math and science academies across the country…and I'll make sure that girls and children of color know they're welcome there as well. Let me close with what's at the foremost in your mind… When elected President I will get rid of No Child Left Behind It's not working, and it's not fair. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not against accountability, but I believe in accountability when it is fair and when schools are funded and given the support they need. President Bush promised to be the education President. But like many other promises and things this administration has said it was going to do, after the photo-ops -- the policy got stuck in a drawer and forgotten. Well, we can't afford to forget our children. In the interest of time here's the short list of the many issues that need to be addressed:  Get rid of the pass/fail model of AYP Provide a more meaningful and honest picture of a school that utilizes more than a single test score  Use fairer tests and realistic timelines for our English Language Learners and Special Education Students Provide more funding to help our students succeed. For example: extending the school year, or extending the school day Provide financial incentives for districts to attract high quality teachers to schools of highest needs, not only in cities, but suburban and rural areas  Here's the bottom line, I'm not an educator, you are! I'm not in the classroom everyday with kids, you are! I'm not the expert, you are! For that reason, when you elect me president I will create a blue ribbon panel for educational excellence and I promise that NEA members will be represented on this panel. In New Mexico, NEA was at the table when we created Making Schools Work! I believe we need to create educational policy from the bottom up, not the top down! It needs to be created from those whose hearts and souls are committed to quality education for all our children…from those who are committed to public education….that is you, and that is me. That's why I will name an educator as my Secretary of Education! Very few things motivate me more to want to be President of the United States than a chance to make a difference in the lives of our kids. And together we can make public education strong…you'll hear from presidential candidates who want you on their team. But you need to ask yourself three things:  Who has been there for me in the past? Who will be there for me in the future? And who has the skill to bring this country together, and not drive us apart?  For the answer to those questions; just look at my record. I got it done, and I will get it done. But I'm going to need your help to do it! Thank you, God Bless you, and all of our educators, God Bless our System of Public Education, and God Bless the United States! Thank you so much for having me here today. I want to talk about our economy -- where we've been and where we're going. Today, the middle class is under siege by numerous forces. Despite increased productivity, wages have stagnated. The job market for most Americans is thin. Health care and energy costs have skyrocketed. So has the price of a college education. Foreclosures are at their highest in years, and millions of Americans are faced with sinking home values. And the one seemingly bright spot of the Bush years -- the stock market -- is tumbling. Enormous budget deficits are the rule, not the exception, and our national debt has soared to $9 trillion dollars. Every year, we spend more than 400 billion dollars just paying the interest on our national debt -- that's more than six times as much as we spend on the entire Department of Education. How did we get here? The story is well known--$1.1 trillion in tax cuts, far too skewed to help the wealthiest Americans, and runaway spending, have put us deep in the red. While this President has blamed 9/11 for our deficits, the fact of the matter is that defense and homeland security spending, including all of the hundreds of billions in Iraq, has accounted for only one third of the post-9/11 deficits. The Administration's misguided tax and spending priorities account for the rest. I am a pro-growth Democrat, one who believes our party must stand for policies that encourage innovation and expand economic opportunity. I strongly believe in cutting taxes responsibly -- tax cuts that help the middle class and tax incentives for creating jobs. The Bush tax cuts, on the other hand, have cost $1.1 trillion dollars, and resulted in the worst record of job-creation since Herbert Hoover. This Administration forgot to invest in our future. In his 2006 State of the Union, President Bush shocked the world by admitting that America was "addicted to oil," suggesting that we might see some investment in new energy. The very next day, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory announced that the White House had cut its budget by $28 million. How can we expect an Administration that couldn't even plan its own politics a day ahead, to lead our nation toward a better future for our children? The Administration failed to protect the engine of our economy -- the middle class. Productivity is up, yet real wages are down. American workers are holding up their end of the deal, but their government is not. While President Bush was railing against the axis of evil abroad, he was governing across an axis of irresponsibility here at home: failure to be fiscally responsible, failure to invest in the future, failure to protect working Americans. Now we are saddled with a budget deficit they ignore and foreign debt they don't want to talk about. President Bush hasn't leveled with us about our nation's fiscal health since 2001. Frankly, the President is acting like a spoiled teenager who crashes the family car and then hopes no one will notice. Well, Mr. President, we have noticed. And the American government needs to stop breaking what the American family has built. My friends, it is time we take our future back. FISCAL RESPONSIBILITYThe first thing we have to do is get out of our fiscal nightmare. That starts with a balanced budget. As a Governor, I have to balance my state's budget. I have balanced five budgets, and I have done it while cutting taxes and investing in our people and our infrastructure. Balancing the budget is investing in the future. It means that we are paying for what we get today, so our children don't have to. And that's why I support a Constitutional Amendment to balance the budget; this amendment must also provide for a line-item veto. We've allowed Republicans to spend recklessly for too long. Our children should have the right to be free from the extraordinary debts run up by their parents. Ultimately, there is no choice between fiscal responsibility and fiscal prosperity. As we saw under the Clinton Administration, you can't have one without the other. The road to fiscal responsibility should begin with ending the war and getting all of our troops out of Iraq. All of them. It is the right thing to do for our fighting men and women; it is the right thing to do for our national defense; and it is the right thing to do for our economic security. We spend over a hundred billion dollars a year hunkered down in a country that doesn't want us there, fighting a war that won't make us safer. We want that money back. Second, we need to end waste here at home. No more pork-barrel spending. No more thousand-dollar toasters, no more Bridges to Nowhere. The federal budget isn't a politician's piggy-bank. Eliminating earmarks will save us at least $40 billion over the next five years. We want that money back. Third, we need to slash corporate welfare. In 2006 alone, American taxpayers shelled out 92 billion dollars to corporations. It just doesn't make sense. In the 1980's, President Reagan liked to talk about the "welfare queen" who bilked the government out of eight thousand dollars. Well we've got welfare queens today -- they're called Halliburton and Exxon/Mobil. And trust me, they're getting more than eight thousand dollars. If we cut even half of our spending on corporate welfare, Americans will save some 230 billion dollars over the next five years. We want that money back. We should also stop tax cuts for individuals who don't need them. When I am President we will roll back the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest, which will save us hundreds of billions of dollars over the next five years. Instead, we'll cut taxes to create jobs and help the middle class. We will have a tax credit for companies that create jobs here in America and pay above the prevailing wage. I've done it in New Mexico and it works. We have to stop giving companies incentives to send our jobs abroad. We need American businesses to keep American jobs here. We will provide strong tax incentives to promote renewable energy because we need a new generation of energy entrepreneurs. We need new wildcatters to tap the power of wind, solar, and biofuel. The energy crisis will only be solved by the efforts of enterprising individuals, but government must push the effort forward. We will eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax for the middle class. When the President claims he's going to balance the budget, he intends to do it on the backs of millions of middle class families, by forcing them to pay a tax they were never supposed to. We need to right this unintended wrong. Instead of forcing the middle class to pay new taxes, we will extend the tax cuts for the middle class. When I am President, we will have a tax system that reflects our belief in hard work and our hope for a better tomorrow. Once we've repaired the foundations of our economy, we need to start building for the future. INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIONAmerica has always been the world's greatest purveyor of ingenuity and innovation. More than Cokes and Hershey bars, cars and computers, the world knows us as the preeminent seller of progress and hope. Historically, our technological prowess has been unmatched. That is no accident. Because we value science -- because we have invested in knowledge and education -- we have led technological change. Today, however, our strategic competitors, like China, are catching up. Again, this is no accident. Nor is it inevitable. They are catching up because they are succeeding where we have in the past, but are not today. They are investing heavily in math and science education; we are not. They are investing heavily in scientific research; we are cutting back. There is no doubt that this coming century will bring technological progress we can't imagine today. Eminent scientists in labs and universities and unknown kids tinkering in their garages will guide us to the frontiers of discovery. This will happen. The question we have to ask ourselves is: do we want those garages to be in China or right here in Iowa. Do we want our nation's universities just teaching new knowledge, or discovering it? There is only one choice. As a nation, we have never turned our back on tomorrow. The search for new frontiers and the hope that we can improve is far too ingrained in our national DNA. If we do not embrace progress now, and invest in the future, though our borders will not have changed, we will not be the same nation. George Bush and his right wing allies talk about protecting the "free market economy" to justify their failed policies. And then they attack Democrats as big taxers and over-regulators. This tired rhetoric is holding us back. The Government must honor the private sector and American entrepreneurship -- while working with investors and partnering with our entrepreneurs. This is how it has always been. The Government started the internet, and the private sector improved and expanded it into one of the cornerstones of our economy. In a 21st Century economy, Government must act as a catalyst and a partner to help unleash the innovation and the job creation potential of the private sector. We're all in this together. When I am President, here is how we will keep this country moving forward. First, we will restore and increase funding for federal research and development programs. If we are serious about science, then we should be serious about funding it. In particular, we should increase funding to the National Institutes of Health, so the next generation doesn't have to suffer the same diseases as this one. We need to increase funding to government renewable energy programs. Even George Bush has acknowledged that we are addicted to oil. But, look, acknowledging your addiction is the first step to recovery. Not the last. Historically, New Mexico has been one of the poorest states in the nation, yet we are funding a stem cell research center, and we are innovators in clean energy. We should be able to do the same in the richest nation in the world. We need to connect people. We should weave our nation's wealth of knowledge, capital, and talent into a Web of Innovation that can catch new technologies. We all believe in a better economy and we should not be afraid to work together. I will start by convening regional Innovation Summits where experts from business and venture capital, academia and government can come together to turn ideas into realities. We must come together to spark real growth, real innovation and real change. It takes leadership on jobs and innovation -- I will lead our country just as I have led New Mexico. I will create a federal Angel Investor Tax Credit and I will make permanent and double the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. We must provide incentives for investment and experimentation in high-tech research and manufacturing. For our economy to get the oxygen it needs breathe, we must grow the trees of technology. And that requires planting the seeds of investment. We have the Angel Investor Tax Credit in New Mexico for high-tech startups that are creating the jobs of the future. And its working. It works because it is quintessentially American. We are a nation of risk-takers. We admire the great Americans who throw themselves into an idea because they believe it is the best idea -- because they believe it is the precious spark of a better future. It is this determination -- this strength of will -- that produced the light bulb, the car, the computer. I believe that if we are to continue our economic and innovative success, we need to reward that great American spirit. And we must also support innovation in our young people. The first point in the Web of Innovation must be our students. Because the next generation of technology means nothing, unless the next generation of Americans knows how to use it. Yet, today, we rank 28th in the world in math and science education. China and India produce far more engineers than we do. This is unacceptable and irresponsible. Despite the overwhelming focus of the popular media, the true foreign threat to American job security doesn't come from uneducated, low-wage workers from poor countries. It comes from highly-educated middle-class workers from these emerging economic giants. We must act now. We must build 250 Math, Science, and Innovation Academies by 2012. These Academies will offer rigorous math and science instruction, free of charge, to seventh-through-twelfth graders who want it. They will train the next wave of American engineers, mathematicians, scientists and teachers. It's a simple equation -- talented math and science teachers lead to inspired and successful math and science students. When I am President, I will commit to hiring one-hundred-thousand new math and science teachers to guarantee that our children and our nation are competitive in the world. The key to economic progress is education, and the key to education is a good teacher in the classroom. Hiring these teachers will cost us three to four billion dollars -- that is less than one one-hundreth the amount we pay in interest on our national debt. It is a small price to pay for a competitive future. If we want to speak the language of progress, our kids must be fluent in science and math. INVESTING IN PEOPLEWhile we build for the future and repair the damage of the past, we must also invest in our people now. We need to move aggressively to create high-quality jobs and expand economic opportunity. The American Dream has always been big -- big enough for all of us. But for too many these days, the dream is shrinking and shutting them out. That is unacceptable -- every American deserves the opportunity to succeed. We need to get back to big dreams and big ideas. If we want more quality jobs, we should give companies incentives to create them. I will offer rebates for businesses that hire disadvantaged children in high school and college. I will create a rural jobs tax credit for companies that create jobs in rural areas and a tax credit for businesses that create manufacturing jobs. I will also provide tax credits to support new businesses in emerging technologies and in low-income areas. I will quadruple the energy tax credit for green jobs -- jobs that are good for the the American worker and the American environment. Just as much as computer programmers and engineers, energy-efficient sheet metal workers, plumbers, electricians, and masons are the key to our economic future. I will lead an Apollo program for renewable energy, green buildings, and energy efficiency. This is the high technology of the future and America must lead it. I agree with the Apollo Alliance on this issue. Green building is good for the environment, it's good for our workers and it's good for our energy bills -- no wonder the Bush administration is against it. The Government must not only lead the way on a new generation of green buildings, but we must also encourage retrofitting our existing businesses. And, instead of building bridges to nowhere, we need to look at our critical infrastructure -- our bridges, roads, transportation that lead our people to work everyday. A public/private partnership, with union involvement, on green building and revitalizing America's infrastructure, will create more high-paying jobs for workers right here in Cedar Rapids. Right here at IBEW Local 405. We need tax and job policies that work. I've shaped effective tax policies in New Mexico that have created over 80,000 jobs, driven unemployment to 3.2% -- a historic low -- and lifted personal income. I know how to get our economy working for all Americans. In addition to creating new quality jobs, we need to preserve the ones we already have. We should restore America's focus on protecting our labor force. First of all, let me say that I will be a friend to working Americans ‘till the day I die. One of my first acts as Governor was to reinstate collective bargaining for public employees in New Mexico. We then dramatically increased health benefits and salaries. We raised our teacher's salaries from 46th to 29th in the nation. I fought hard to raise the minimum wage in my state, and I have improved worker safety. As President, my Secretary of Labor will be a union member. As President, I will protect the right to collective bargaining and the right to form unions. I will strongly support the Employee Free Choice Act. How can we as a nation ask American workers to help protect our future, if we don't allow them to protect theirs? When I am President, we will improve all workers' safety. President Bush has spent the past six years eroding safety regulations and endangering our workforce. How do we expect our economy to grow if its workers aren't safe? And, I will index the minimum wage to inflation. The minimum wage is not just some number; it is a reality for many American families. I believe a fair day's work deserves a fair day's pay, period. How can we even begin to build responsibility, fairness, and a new American dream if we are not strong enough to honor this basic principle? We must also move beyond the debate over "Free Trade" versus "Protectionism." Instead we must roll up our sleeves and pursue better trade agreements; agreements that enhance rather than erode U.S. jobs, and that are socially just, environmentally responsible and politically sustainable. We also need to help families with the rising cost of living. Expenses for health care, child care, and a college education are rising faster than wages and our next President must focus on making these more affordable. Our national strength is our people, and we must do whatever it takes to protect that resource. CONCLUSIONThere is no doubt that we face serious challenges, not the least of which is a President who refuses to face up to them. We are falling behind China in math and science, while we run up a national debt, much of which is owned by that very country. When President Bush says he's increased education funding, he's right. He's increased education funding in China, in India, and every other nation that owns our debt. Right now, we are effectively paying the world to surpass us technologically. That's just not right. We face great challenges, but we are the greatest nation in the history of the world, and our government needs to start acting like it. We need to get back to big American dreams. We need to get back to the forward-looking nation that searched out new frontiers. At the turn of the 19th century, we were a handful of states huddled along the East Coast. By the end of that century, our nation spanned the continent. Americans rode out West on horses and drove back in cars. Our nation is more than a piece of land or a set of laws. America is the belief that tomorrow can be better than today. And united we can do it. Together, we can restore fiscal discipline to our government. Together, we can be the catalyst for innovation. Together, we can keep America's promise to its middle class workers A strong economy is the engine of everything that America does and everything we want this country to be. I've got the record. I've got the experience and I'm ready to meet the challenge being issued by our economic competitors. Thank you. Thank you for having me here. It is an honor to be able to share with you today my thoughts about how we can end the war in Iraq--and also to discuss some lessons which we must learn from this ongoing tragedy. Over 3,800 brave Americans have lost their lives. Nearly 30,000 have been wounded -- many very seriously. 170,000 are still at risk. In addition to our troops, at least a hundred thousand Iraqi civilians have been killed in this conflict. Over four million more -- fifteen percent of the country's population -- have lost their homes and become displaced. Ninety-three percent of Sunnis and over half the Shia think it's okay to shoot an American. The Iraqis want us out of their country. Despite our best intentions, the American presence is not aiding the cause of peace…but rather contributing to the cycle of violence. It did not have to be this way. Our military is the best-trained, best-equipped, most powerful fighting force in the history of the world. Tragically, the awesome power of our military has been matched in scale by the reckless incompetence of our civilian leadership. The President and Vice-President have blundered and mismanaged this conflict at every possible turn. This catastrophe did not need to happen. Many of us, on the eve of this war, counseled greater diplomacy and more patience. Our warnings were ignored and the result has been the quagmire in which we find ourselves. Whether we are Democrats, Independents or Republicans, all Americans want the violence to end. We all know that we must not allow the region to collapse into greater chaos and war. We all know how important it is that our military be strong and able to meet future threats. We all want our brave military men and women out of harm's way. The question, going forward, is how we accomplish these goals. President Bush says that we need to stay the course, indefinitely. He wants us to stick with a strategy that has failed week after week, month after month, year after year, in the hope that, finally…somehow…it will succeed. Our troops have done all that they have been asked to do, with courage and professionalism, but no one can win someone else's civil war. In the absence of political progress, our continued presence in Iraq is increasingly counter-productive. Our troops in Iraq are now the biggest obstacle to political change. If we stay on the present course, if we merely tinker with the mission as some have suggested, historians may look back on the first decade of this century as the moment in which the United States foolishly overstretched itself, beginning the long-term decline of American power and global leadership. Only our departure can break the political stalemate and give us diplomatic leverage to promote reconciliation and regional diplomacy. The longer we stay, the more U.S. troops will die, the more Iraqi civilians will be killed, and the more elusive stability will become. Delaying the inevitable is not a strategy. It is not useful. It is not responsible. It is not courageous. It is not moral. I know that the President is wrong and you know he's wrong. He does not, and perhaps cannot, understand the dire reality of the situation. Throughout his Presidency, Bush has denied reality and avoided difficult choices. After 9/11, he sent the military to war, while he asked the nation to go shopping. In an all-out war against terror, he asked the country to be part-time patriots. We must stop this President and end this war. The foundation of my Iraq plan is this: Get out now. Get all our troops out now. It is the only right and responsible choice. Only when we are on our way out will Iraqis and others in the region start to see us as partners rather than as occupiers. Only then can a new political and diplomatic process begin. So long as we are there, with a bulls-eye on our back, the situation cannot change for the better. Only by withdrawing all of our troops can we give our military the opportunity to rest, refit, and retrain. Our military has been strained to the breaking point by this President. Our troops are serving longer tours in Iraq than they are spending with their families or training back at home -- fifteen month tours. National Guard units are unable to perform essential missions here in the US where they are needed for homeland security. Much of our equipment is wearing down…and the corrosion of our hard power is limiting the leverage of our soft power. Because of Iraq, we cannot focus on the real threats to our security -- a fact acknowledged even by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker in their recent Senate testimony. Because of Iraq, al Qaeda has been able to reconstitute itself. Today it is stronger than ever, training terrorists along the Pakistan -- Afghanistan border. Because of Iraq, we have lost the credibility we need to lead the world to stop nuclear proliferation and trafficking. President Bush's failed strategy has made us both pariahs and patrons of both Sunni and Shia. We are both ally and enemy of Iraqi factions. And we subsidize their power struggles with American lives and dollars. This endless, multi-sided violence has muddied our strategic purpose. And the President's desperate refusal to face reality has confused our moral compass. I know this region. As US Ambassador to the United Nations, I spent eighty percent of my time on the Middle East. I have negotiated with many Arab and Muslim leaders, including the Saudis, the Iranians, even the Taliban. I stood toe-to-toe with Saddam Hussein and got him to release American hostages. I understand the politics and the mentality of that part of the world. Only once we make it clear that we are leaving can we expect the Iraqis to make the tough choices necessary for reconciliation. Only once all of our troops are on their way out, will others in the region do what they must to prevent Iraq from collapsing. Only our departure will give us the credibility to convene a Dayton-style reconciliation conference to build a power-sharing arrangement policed by multilateral, UN-sanctioned peacekeepers. To the extent that such a contingent is staffed by disciplined forces from non-neighboring Muslim countries, it will have a credibility which western troops simply don't have in that part of the world. And only when we leave can we expect rich countries from the region and elsewhere to help finance Iraq's reconstruction. We cannot follow Bush's example of ignoring the governments of Iran and Syria. We must work with them as we pull our troops out. They too have an enormous stake in not allowing Iraq to collapse. The subsequent flood of refugees and economic destruction would cause immeasurable damage to their own national interests. The Bush Administration's current approach to Iran is as wrongheaded as its Iraq policy. And some in the Senate, including Senator Clinton, have aided this approach by voting for their irresponsible resolution on Iran. People want to end this war in Iraq…not start another one. Iran must not be allowed to have nuclear weapons. I will make that commitment as President. However, an attack on Iran will make them stronger -- not weaker -- in the Islamic world. Senator Clinton has it exactly backward. To accomplish our goals with Iran, we have to put diplomacy first, not saber rattling. No country has ever been forced to give up nuclear weapons-- many have been persuaded to Furthermore, there is only one way to accomplish our objectives in Iraq. There is only one responsible way forward: Get ALL our troops out and get them out NOW. We must also remove the private mercenaries. As President, I will no longer privatize and outsource American security! By utilizing contractors who are not subject to the rules of war or the regulations of armed forces, George Bush has further undermined America's reputation and global leadership. It's no surprise that President Bush doesn't see that. From the beginning of this war, up through this fatal surge, the President has refused to make the hard choices or the right choices. The whole point of the surge was to give breathing room to Iraqi politicians, and it has failed miserably. Even General Petraeus admitted that there has been no political progress. After seven years of this Administration, we have come to expect that George Bush will make the wrong call on the important issues. However, I expected more -- much more -- from my fellow Democrats in this race. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards have said we have to wait and see how things go before we can know how many troops to bring out and how quickly. I say there has been enough waiting and seeing. If you haven't seen enough to know that we need to get all the troops out then you aren't watching the same war that I and the rest of America are seeing. I don't think just changing the mission is enough -- we need to end the war. Senator Clinton has reportedly said that she might well have troops still in Iraq at the end of a second term -- 9 years from now. Senator Obama and John Edwards are unwilling to commit to removing all of the troops by the end of their first term -- that's 5 years from now. I am opposed to 5 years or 9 years or any more years of our troops dying. My colleagues are wrong. Military analysts have said that Senator Clinton's plan could require leaving up to 75,000 troops in Iraq. That's changing the mission, not ending the war. Obama and Edwards have said that they will pull our combat troops out, but they would leave thousands, tens of thousands of non-combat troops behind. Think of what this means: tens of thousands of support troops, unprotected, in the middle of a civil war. That is changing the mission, not ending the war. What do they think such a smaller force, with no combat protection, can accomplish that 170,000 troops could not? I have asked them, over and over again, every chance I get. Their silence has been deafening. I deeply respect my Democratic colleagues, but their plans simply will not end this war. It is going to take more than a sound bite and more than waiting and seeing -- it is going to take decisive leadership. This is no time for political calculation or hopeful caution. Our troops' lives are on the line. We need a responsible, comprehensive strategy to end the war and the strength to execute it. We need to get all of our troops out. And we need to do it as quickly as possible. What my colleagues are suggesting -- a slow, protracted exit -- will only multiply the casualties and delay political progress. President Nixon chose such a slow departure from Vietnam. It led to 28,000 additional American deaths and perhaps another million Vietnamese deaths. And it accomplished nothing -- soon after we left, the Communists took over. Moving all the troops out quickly will require careful planning, but it can be done. In accordance with Army doctrine, non-combat troops should leave the theatre first. Not the other way around as many of my colleagues suggest. Their approach would leave our men and women far more vulnerable. We have rotated as many as 240,000 troops into and out of Iraq in a three-month period earlier in this war. After the first Gulf War, we redeployed a half million troops in a period of four months. As we redeploy, we also must work closely with Turkey to insure the stability of the border and the security of Kurdish areas. Rapid maneuver is one of the time honored strengths of our military. Swift movement saves lives -- the longer a redeployment takes, the longer our brave troops will remain under fire. I have confidence in our armed forces. The naysayers who doubt our capability to get out rapidly and safely are wrong. To rejoin the fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda -- and to encourage greater efforts by Pakistan and our NATO allies, we should redeploy additional combat brigades to Afghanistan. Some troops also must redeploy into quick strike forces based in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Bahrain. Our military presence in friendly nations will enable us to meet new dangers and hit al Qaeda training camps wherever they might appear. Respected experts like Sandy Berger, Dr. Lawrence Korb, General William Odom, and General Robert Gard have looked at the evidence and come to similar conclusions to mine. They know that Washington groupthink is no substitute for careful analysis of real options. You may have heard me speak elsewhere about my foreign policy, "The New Realism." I believe that to meet the challenges of the 21st century, America must move beyond both the fantasy of neo-conservatism -- and also beyond the limitations of traditional old-world balance-of-power Realism. We must face the reality that global threats have changed. Great dangers come not just from hostile nations, but also from hostile individuals and failed states -- as well as from underlying social and economic trends, like our continuing addiction to fossil fuels. These are dangers that threaten every person on the planet. Jihadism, AIDS, nuclear proliferation, and climate change do not respect national borders. And no nation can meet these challenges alone. Our national interests are global interests. Restoring American leadership means abandoning rogue cowboy diplomacy. It means giving up the idea of stubborness as a foreign policy. It means restoring those American principles that once allowed us to build the alliances that defeated the Nazis and crumbled the Soviet Union. Rebuilding American diplomacy will require power. Let us have no illusions -- we do have the power. We have the power in the strongest military force in the world, the strongest economy in the world and an unmatched technological prowess. We must combine these extraordinairy strengths with a "New Realism" to better confront the challenges that we face. Constructing this new realism will require abandoning the illusion that America can lead without legitimacy. Diplomacy without power is weak, and power without diplomacy is blind. Others will choose to follow us only when they share our goals and admire our values. The chaos and disorder in Iraq teach us that in today's world our armed forces need to defeat more than just armies. They also must defeat hatred and propaganda. Our military must be the fist that destroys our enemies -- but it also must be a steadfast hand that creates a better peace. Nearly five years after the initial invasion, our military is battle-tested, but war-weary. Bush and Cheney threw our troops into the fire in Iraq. But now we must forge from that fire something stronger and more adaptable to the new dangers we face. We need to learn from Iraq and make sure that our military is prepared to deter, fight, and win the wars of the future. And to fight 21st century wars, we need a 21st century military. One lesson we must learn is to give our Generals the numbers they need for post-war stabilization. Another lesson is to make sure that our troops are trained for the complex tasks they will face. Ninety-seven percent of US deaths in the war have occurred after the end of so-called major combat operations -- after, quote,Mission Accomplished. We need to forge a military than can win both the war and the peace. The military paradigm of this century will be what retired Marine Commandant General Charles Krulak (CREW-LACK) has called the three-block war. In this war, the lines between combat, stability, and humanitarian operations blur -- soldiers deliver humanitarian aid on one block of a city, conduct stability operations on the next block, and fight an armed enemy on the third. This is precisely what is happening in Iraq on a vast scale. Our military must be prepared for this new kind of war. Our military culture must adapt to this new reality. Let me be clear. As President, I will ensure that our soldiers always have the best tools to crush every possible enemy. A war-fighting ability that emphasizes the precise and overwhelming application of force will remain the centerpeice of our military culture. This is my unwavering commitment. Our challenge will be to augment this foundation with a new, larger and better trained force. We can strengthen and expand our military through several reforms. We need promotion and selection policies that incentivize learning the skill-sets needed for counter-insurgency, peace-keeping, conflict resolution, and training foreign militaries. We should create permanent Civil Affairs positions -- troops who bridge the gap between soldiers and civilians -- into all appropriate units, and we should expand Civil Affairs training for all soldiers and Marines likely to interact with foreign nationals. We must better integrate civilians into our military operations so there is seamless coordination among military, diplomatic and political actions. We need to increase cross-agency tours of duty between the military and other parts of government. The personal relationships and institutional knowledge shared during these tours will strengthen the versatility and effectiveness of our fighting forces. We also need to make the military more attractive to men and women who have real experience in nation-building and social and economic development. Just as we do for chaplains, doctors and lawyers, professionals with such skills should be able to enter the military as Warrant Officers or at the rank of Captain. As we reform training and selection, we must reorder our budget priorities. I have produced a plan that includes $57 billion in specific cuts to unnecessary Pentagon spending, such as the V-22 Osprey, freeing up resources for essential needs. We need to invest less in planes and more in people -- less in outdated missiles and more in state-of-the-art troops. After years of excessive use, we must refit our military's depleted equipment stocks. We must strengthen laws that protect our deployed Guardsmen and Reservists from losing their jobs and businesses. When I am President, we will stop wasting billions of dollars on Cold War weapons systems designed to fight a long extinct Soviet empire. We will save tens of billions of dollars more by stopping the construction of unnecessary new nuclear weapons. Instead of building new nuclear weapons, we should be negotiating further reductions in all nuclear arsenals around the world. In an age of terrorism, the greatest nuclear threat will come not on a missile, but rather in a suitcase or a cargo hull. To meet the danger of nuclear terrorism, we need to reduce the number of weapons in the world, and we need to consolidate and secure fissile material around the globe. Protecting America from this very real threat of nuclear terrorism will require new thinking and global negotiations. It will require focused and determined American leadership. It will NOT require new nuclear weapons. It will NOT require Star Wars. Our national military effectiveness WILL, however, require more troops in uniform. We should never again hear the phrases stop-loss or extended deployment. We need two more Active Army divisions and one additional Active Marine Corps division. This will expand our military by some 50,000 troops and give us the flexibility we need for 21st century missions. The responsible way forward for Iraq and for our military will not be traveled easily. Hard choices lie ahead. We have to get out of Iraq, learn from errors made, and augment and reform our military so that it can meet the new challenges of a new era. Difficult days indeed lie ahead, as we recover from the Iraq debacle, restore and modernize our military, and rebuild our reputation as a nation that leads others toward noble and worthy goals. The challenges are many, but as the next President, I am committed to meeting them. And with your support we cannot fail. May God bless our fighting men and women, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you so much for being here today. As we stand here today, our schools have again been stricken by tragedy. Our prayers go out to the students and parents of Cleveland, Ohio. Each senseless act of violence lessens us all. Every American loses a piece of his or her heart. Every American must again grieve. Every American feels a little less safe. We must do everything possible to ensure that schools become safe havens. I will and we must insist that national attention is given to preparedness for school safety at the K-12 level and in higher education as well. I will require all schools to develop safety protocols and policies to be used in an emergency. And I renew my call for national instant background checks on all gun sales, including at gun shows. We must keep guns out of the hands of the irresponsible -- criminals and the mentally ill. I want to talk to you about how we can fix our education system ... because the fact is, it's broken. It's broken from top to bottom. Too many kids lack access to pre-K ... not enough graduate high school. Too many of our young people are unprepared for college ... not enough can afford to go. Too many of our workers are falling behind the rest of the world ... not enough are getting the training they need to compete. There have been too many promises ... and not enough leadership. George Bush promised to be the education President. You know how far that promise got? About as far as his promise on inauguration day to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. About as far as his promise to take real action on global warming. About as far as his promise to be fiscally responsible. Far from leaving no child behind, the Bush Administration seems to have left reality behind. The President talks about an ownership society, then cuts funding for workforce training. He talks about freedom, but his actions have left young college graduates shackled by debt. The President talks about an America we can all believe in; then he delivers policies that benefit only a few. Enough is enough. The past seven years have been a dark period in our nation's history. It's time we turn on the lights. Education is the spark that lights minds. As we ignite schools across the country, we can kindle a great fire of learning that will light the way to the future. We must begin with educating our young people, but we cannot stop there. Learning should not end at eighteen. And every American must have a part in the basic promise of our nation -- that we can make every tomorrow better than today. That starts with building the best public school system in the world. Compromises will not do. We must skip the caution. Skip the half measures. What we need is bold change. My Democratic opponents have been cautious in confronting George Bush on this issue. Just as they trusted George Bush on the Iraq war and the Patriot Act, they trusted him on No Child Left Behind. The result has been a travesty for our children. Some say fix it, others say tweak it. Senator Hillary Clinton says reform it. I also have two words for No Child Left Behind: Scrap It. As a Governor I have seen first-hand the impact of this failed policy on our children. And although Senator Clinton and some of my other opponents voted for it, they should admit their error, and join my call for real change. The key to a good education is not narrow tests or Washington wisdom. The key is a good teacher in every classroom. We need to attract and retain the best and brightest for our nation's schools. We need to start treating teachers with the professional respect that they have earned. When I am President, teachers will have a national average starting salary of $40,000. We will improve and expand teacher training ... and strengthen standards and accountability. We will increase the number of nationally-certified teachers. I will provide bonuses and create a loan forgiveness program for teachers who choose to work in under-performing and high-poverty areas. I also commit to you that I will hire 100,000 new math and science teachers. It's a simple equation -- talented math and science teachers lead to inspired and successful math and science students. High-quality math and science education is not optional. It is essential to holding our position as the world's leader of progress and hope. And I will set a national goal of making America number one in the world in math and science within fifteen years. I will convene a national summit on Educational Standards and Accountability. We need to develop national Gold Standards that the states can adopt. We should move from a pass/fail model to a more comprehensive system of measurement. Narrow tests will only create narrow people. In general, we need to end the policy of punishment that Bush gave us with No Child Left Behind. If a school fails, we shouldn't punish that school, we should help it. I also promise that I will strongly and steadfastly oppose school vouchers. Outsourcing our public education is simply wrong. The solution to the problems with our public schools is not just giving up on them. We must reject vouchers, which divert needed resources from our public schools. But we must also encourage choice by supporting charter schools. In New Mexico, this philosophy has made my state second in the nation for school choice. Charter schools work. Vouchers do not. We should not try to shrink our public school system ... we should be working to expand it. As President, I will provide universal access to quality pre-K programs to all four-year-olds. And I will fully fund Head Start. Just as an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of the cure ... a year of early education is worth several years of remedial education. The benefits of early education are clear and extensive. The evidence shows that those who participate in pre-k end up with better earnings, better employment, and better savings later in life ... as well as fewer arrests, fewer out-of-wedlock births, and less drug use. We need to get our kids into school earlier and we need to ensure that they make it all the way through. Overall, our high school graduation rate is only seventy percent -- each year one million students drop out of high school. Minority students are even worse off -- only 56 percent of African Americans and 52 percent of Latinos graduate. It is just not right. I will provide a billion dollars per year to help states expand their dropout prevention programs. This is a small price to pay. It is estimated that each class of high school dropouts costs our nation 200 billion dollars in lost wages and tax revenue. Furthermore I will devote particular attention to minority students, who are most at risk of dropping out. These are the basics, and we all know that we need to get back to basics. But we've also got to raise the bar. We have to take bold steps toward a comprehensive vision of learning and education. I will create 250 Math, Science, and Innovation Academies. These Academies will offer rigorous math and science instruction, free of charge, to seventh-through-twelfth graders who want it. They will train the next wave of American engineers, mathematicians, scientists, and teachers. And I will put the arts back into our schools. Students who engage in the arts are more likely to get involved in community and charity work. These students do better academically. Arts education is not a silver bullet, but it is a lighted bridge. It's long past time the President ordered a comprehensive analysis of the quality and extent of arts education in our schools. I will do that. I will provide 250 million dollars for the NEA's Arts in Education programs. We will pay for musical instruments and music teachers in underserved communities throughout the country. And we will make art and music therapy available for children with emotional and developmental challenges. I will fiercely support state and local efforts to stress arts education in their curricula. The federal government will offer extra matching funds to states that draw up their own, comprehensive art programs. In addition to reconsidering what our students learn, we have to reconsider how they learn. We need to redesign America's high schools for the twenty-first century. We should use the best technology to create more flexible learning environments. We need to increase opportunities for Advanced Placement and online courses. We need to increase access to higher education by supporting dual enrollment. And we should align high school exit and college entrance criteria. We did this in New Mexico and it works. Furthermore, we need to increase the rigor and relevance of high school classes. Too many students drop out because they just don't see the point of staying in. And we have to create smaller learning communities -- not only smaller class sizes, but also smaller schools. And we should encourage smaller groups within schools, like freshman academies. In addition, we need to promote the welfare of our nation's children. An essential part of educating better citizens...is ensuring that they are safe and healthy. As President, I will work with the states to adopt healthier nutrition policies for schools. I will increase participation in school breakfast programs. I will bring back physical education. We did it in New Mexico -- we took junk food out of the schools and put Phys-Ed back in. And I supported funding for healthy school breakfasts. We also doubled the number of school-based health clinics. As President, I will provide incentives to open these clinics across the country. Finally, we have to get parents -- all parents -- more involved in the education of our nation's students. Teachers cannot do it alone, no matter how good they are. Parental involvement is more important to a child's success than any test or book. As President, I will issue an executive order that provides all federal employees with eight hours per year of paid, one-to-one time with their children. And I will encourage businesses and the rest of the public sector to do the same. The Republicans can talk all they want about family values -- I will do something that actually promotes them. I will also help states with the type of parental outreach that has worked in my state. In New Mexico, we created a parent involvement toolkit that provides easy and practical strategies for teachers and principals. We also developed parent-to-parent DVD's to educate parents on how they can help their children succeed in school. I know that the strategies I've outlined will work ... because they have worked in New Mexico. When I first took office, my state ranked 46th in the nation for teacher pay. Now, we have jumped to 29th. We improved salaries and accountability by increasing compensation in conjunction with increased performance. We've provided incentives for teachers to become national board-certified. Today, an average of 94 percent of our teachers are rated Highly Qualified -- a major increase since 2005. We moved money from administration to teaching and we invested an additional 600 million dollars in our classrooms. We also put in place a full-day kindergarten program and initiated statewide pre-K for every four-year-old in New Mexico. I am proud that our school reform initiative was ranked second in the nation by the Fordham Foundation. But we didn't stop with primary education. We took the bold, necessary steps to increase access to higher education. I signed legislation expanding the merit-based New Mexico Lottery Scholarship Fund. We created a need-based College Affordability Fund and endowed it with a hundred million dollars. I also enacted a tax credit for college tuition and fees. We improved access to higher education because it was right for our students, and it was right for our state. In the twenty-first century, college cannot be the province of the wealthy and the elite. In our increasingly competitive world, higher education is often an absolute requirement for a decent job. But these days, too many of our young people are unprepared for college. And too many of those that are prepared ... cannot afford to go. Only 57 percent of those who graduate high school enroll directly in college the following year. The Bush Administration has presided over soaring college costs. Between 2001 and 2010, two million high school graduates will have been priced out of a college education. And those that do go get to go ... will graduate with extraordinary debts. It is unacceptable. As a nation, we cannot abide the status quo, and we cannot afford fewer college graduates. The cost is simply too high. Whenever President Bush cuts access to college, he cuts back hope, and he cuts down progress. We must do better. As President, I will make college affordable and accessible to every high school graduate who wants to attend. I will offer meaningful incentives for schools to keep tuition costs under control, including additional grants and loans. And we need to simplify the college aid process. The form that families have to fill out to get college aid, the FAFSA, is 127 questions. That's longer than the form to get US citizenship. Something's wrong when it's more complicated to get money for school than it is to become an American citizen. I will tear up the FAFSA and replace it with a postcard-sized form. This will expand access to a consolidated, National Endowment for College Affordability. President Bush has increased student loan funding -- to private banks. I will eliminate his 15 million dollar a day subsidy to banks and private lenders ... and redirect that money to students who need it. And I will increase aid to students who need it the most. I will expand programs like LEAP and GEAR UP that help students from low-income families. Finally, I will call on Americans to serve their country and the world. After 9/11, Americans stood ready to serve. But President Bush asked most of us to sit back and sulk. We need real leadership NOW. The vital spirit of service that fought the Nazis in the forties and sustained the Peace Corps in the sixties ... is alive in America today. As President, I will create a national service program that pays two years of college for one year of service. We need more college graduates. And we need more men and women who are willing to serve their fellow citizens. So let us once again measure our national greatness not by the hardness of our walls or the easy accumulation of material things ... but by the cultivation of learning, the quality of our national character, and the frank determination to make tomorrow better than today -- for all mankind. This is the solemn promise of our nation -- that all Americans can make life better for themselves and their families and their fellow Americans. I believe that there should be second acts in American lives ... and third acts, and fourth acts, and fifth acts. And if we are to uphold this solemn promise, then our commitment to education cannot end with high school ... it cannot end with college ... it cannot end, period. We have to make sure that our workers get the training they need. We have to make sure that Americans remain competitive in a rapidly changing world. President Bush doesn't seem to understand. Since 2002, total funding for the Employment and Training Administration has declined by 25 percent. In New Mexico, we've worked diligently to improve workforce development programs, in combination with a tax structure that encourages job growth. The results speak for themselves. 80,000 more jobs -- good jobs. And an unemployment rate of about 3.7 percent, near the lowest in New Mexico's history. I know how to create and maintain quality jobs, and I know we can do it across the country. While workforce development cannot be dictated by the bureaucracy in Washington, the President must lead on this issue. In the face of globalization and lost jobs, the government must help working Americans in transition. We also have to give underserved Americans the opportunity to learn the skills they need to succeed in the workforce. I will create a new grant program for community colleges of 400 million dollars per year. Community colleges must play a central role in American life. These satellites of higher learning project the power of education into communities across the country, educating the workforce of thousands of businesses. It is essential that we fully support and fund them. Let me tell you why I care deeply about education and why my plan is so much bolder than what my colleagues are offering. I know first-hand how a teacher can make a difference in a kid's life. When I came back to America at the age of thirteen, the other students were ahead of me. If I had been left on my own, I might have fallen through the cracks -- as so many students do today. It was a teacher who made the difference. Every young American needs a teacher who can make a difference in their lives. That's what my plan is about. The vision I have outlined is bold and comprehensive. It is also expensive. Unlike the timid plans of others, mine is a 60 billion dollar investment in our nation's future. To those who ask how we can afford it, let me be specific. I will cut billions of dollars in loan subsidies to private banks and lenders. Furthermore, last week, I outlined a detailed plan for defense modernization that saves 57 billion dollars by cutting Pentagon waste and outdated, unnecessary weapons systems, many of which were designed for the Cold War. These are detailed, responsible cuts -- some of them to nuclear programs in my own state of New Mexico. This money must be reinvested in our nation's students and schools. I issue a challenge to every one of my opponents: be bold and be specific. Follow my lead and tell the country how you will make America's education system the greatest in the world. We can be the best again. In fact, we must be. It will require the efforts of every American, but together, I know we can do it. Thank you. Thank you for that kind introduction. It's always good to be back here in the heartland. I want to speak with you about urgent threats that America and the community of nations face. Global challenges that pose serious dangers to the future welfare of the human race. For decades, we believed that the only Apocalyptic threat to human civilization was the possibility of nuclear war. Now we know better. We know that poverty and overpopulation affect us all. Refugee crises. Pandemic diseases. Climate change. Environmental degradation. Resource Depletion. Ethnic and political instability. These are not just the problems of individual nations. They are the problems of an interdependent world. These threats are insidious. They may take decades to develop. And they respect no borders. Problems that span time and continents can only be solved through coordinated and cooperative global efforts. From the deserts of Mesopotamia to the jungles of Central America, civilizations of the past, great and small, have been overcome despite the invincibility of their armies. Famine has wiped out entire peoples. Disease has crippled whole nations. Overpopulation has sunk full continents. In the past, resource shortages destroyed civilizations. Today, they could destroy civilization itself. We are the most powerful nation in the history of the world. Yet, we are not immune from such threats. It will take vigilance and bold action now, to preserve our safety for the future. If we wait ten or twenty or fifty years to address these problems, it will already be too late. Environmental degradation takes many forms, but the most urgent is global climate change. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that the planet is getting hotter. This is a fact, not a forecast. The ice caps and glaciers are melting. Sea levels are rising. 300 million human beings live less than fifteen feet above sea level. Unless we act now, homes, villages, cities, and entire nations will be submerged. Those not displaced by rising waters may go hungry as our unrestrained addiction to fossil fuels threatens both regional and global food shortages. Already severe drought has cut the world's maize crops by as much as 15%, and wheat supplies will soon be at their lowest level in 26 years. In a world where hundreds of millions go to bed hungry, major losses in staple crops foretell a time when we wake up to billions starving. In America ... in a nation that has long fed the world...catastrophically rising temperatures threaten to decimate our farmland. Here in Iowa, the foundation for an entire way of life could melt away. Meanwhile, the destruction of forest continues at an alarming rate. Forests absorb carbon from the atmosphere, slowing the pollution that causes global warming. They are critical to the air we breathe and the soil that sustains us. But unsustainable development pollutes that air and erode that soil. Slashing and burning threatens the mesh of life itself. Every species is entangled with the lives of others. As we slash away individual strings, it is increasingly likely that the entire web will collapse. Our unsustainable habits extend across the land and into the ocean -- from sea to dying sea. If we continue on the present course of exploitation, world fisheries will be virtually depleted by the middle of the century. Many once-productive fisheries have already been destroyed. Only 23% of world fish stocks are in good condition. More than one billion people depend on fish as their main source of protein. We are wiping out not only food for hundreds of millions of people, but also threatening the awe-inspiring diversity of ocean life. Our oceans are a precious, but not an infinite resource. Neither are fresh water supplies. Today, one out of every five human beings on the planet does not have access to safe drinking water. Studies conclude that droughts caused by climate change could leave up to one and a half billion people without enough water to survive. Changes in the global distribution of fresh water will cause long-term droughts in some of the world's most fertile food-producing regions. India and China could be devastated. In some poverty-stricken parts of the world, like Somalia, governments have been replaced by warlord gangs. Stability has given way to chaos and even famine. The West African nation of Ghana was long one of the region's most promising economies. The water that once roared through the nation's Volta Dam has been reduced to a trickle. Drought is crippling that nation's economy. In the face of these cascading global threats, Congress and the President have been largely paralyzed. Rather than rallying the nation and the world to face up to the dangers of climate change, the Bush administration claimed for years -- against the overwhelming scientific consensus -- that the "science was unproven." Dick Cheney wrote our energy policy with oil companies, behind closed doors. The congress has gone along for the ride. The power of lobbyists, rather than the power of science, has determined our environmental policies. Washington is broken. Time has run out. It is now urgent that Congress stand up to this President now, and that the next President provide energetic leadership to address these crises. We must be determined, courageous, far-sighted and bold. At stake, is our national survival and our survival as a species. Al Gore's tireless and inspiring work to rally the world to confront these grave dangers has now been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and I congratulate him. Earlier this year, a report issued by eleven retired U.S. generals and admirals confirmed his warnings and described the climate crisis a "serious threat to America's national security." Our national safety is more than enough reason to act. But it is not the only reason that we must. At stake, is the health and welfare of the human race. The world is looking to America for leadership. We cannot fail. Americans are a generous people, and a courageous people. We rescued Europe from fascism, and generations from despair. Our farms have been the breadbasket to the world, and our scientists have saved millions of lives through such discoveries as antibiotics and the polio vaccine. And we are the nation that lit the fire of human freedom. But the Bush Administration has failed to live up to our unmatched record of human achievement. Many of the fights that America used to lead are now being lost. Consider the health of humankind. Over the past 35 years we've seen the emergence of more than thirty new incurable and infectious diseases, such as AIDS and Ebola. At the same time, older pathogens -- malaria, cholera, tuberculosis and many others -- have become more resistant to treatment. They are spreading with a vengeance. Malaria alone takes a human life every thirty seconds -- most of them children. And disease disproportionately strikes those with the least resources to fight back. More than a billion people survive on less than a dollar a day, and nearly half of the world's 2 billion children live in poverty. But we cannot comprehend the crushing burden of global poverty through statistics alone. Even in America, I have walked in communities with no access to clean water. We have all seen shamefully inadequate housing, and we know that even in our own country there are children that go to bed hungry every night. In my travels abroad, I have seen human desperation -- first hand. In the Sudan, I have been to camps filled with families who have lost every worldly possession. I was on the ground in Turkey during a terrible earthquake, where I saw impoverished mothers on their knees, digging through rubble for their lost children. I've spent time in Darfur which today is the best-known example of environmental pressures cascading into instability and violence. A prolonged drought decimated the region's grazing lands and nomadic herders moved south in search of water and food. They encroached upon farming land that belonged to other tribes, igniting the conflict that now has turned into a genocide. We urgently need to find the courage and the will to address such crises. Not only because we are a decent and compassionate people, but also because of this inescapable reality: America will never be safe in a world riddled by poverty, desperation, hatred and violence. A hungry world will also hunger for scapegoats. A thirsty world will thirst for revenge. A world in crisis will be a world of anger and violence and terrorism. And unless and until we have the wisdom and the skill to secure all the nuclear weapons and fissile material in the world, that terrorism could result in unthinkable death and destruction. The global community needs leadership that will take the bold steps necessary to address wide-scale poverty, environmental degradation, and societal unrest. I have travelled the world again and again, on many international delegations and personal missions. And it has been me -- the American -- from which the most has been asked. And so it should be. The world expects much from America. And we must expect even more from ourselves. I believe that the United States alone can rise to the challenge of leading a worldwide effort to avert these global threats. Today I lay out a new path ... and I ask Americans to join me. We will craft a new foreign policy adapted to a world of complex challenges. Challenges which will require thoughtful and global solutions. No nation can defend its own interests without blending them with the interests of others ... and seeking common solutions to common problems. This "New Realism" will at once require us to anchor our diplomacy with time- tested, reality-based principles ... and it will unleash our potential to achieve dramatic change. The first momentous step will be to partner with developed nations, the UN, non-profit organizations, and private sector companies, to create a Marshall Plan for the 21st Century. We need a massive, multilateral effort to assist the developing world in eliminating poverty, protecting the environment, combating pandemics, conserving water supplies, and stimulating economic opportunity. This 21st Century Marshall Plan will be composed of several initiatives to face down global threats. First, I will make the U.S. the world leader in the fight against global poverty. We must have the resolve to honor our UN Millennium goal commitments. And we must have the audacity to demand that others meet theirs. A Commission on the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, composed of world leaders and prominent experts, should be created to help all countries realize their Millennium commitments. When I am President, the United States will again lead on debt relief, and shifting aid from loans to grants. We will focus on primary health care and affordable vaccines. I also believe that the World Bank is the not the place for politics. Its only ideology must be the relief of suffering, with a single-minded focus on poverty reduction. The IMF must recognize that social safety nets are no barrier -- indeed they are essential -- to promoting economic growth around the world. The United States must increase its financial contribution to these international protection and development initiatives. We must ask other wealthy nations to do the same. Stimulating small-scale business in poor countries is essential. And we know what works. Clearly, we should focus more resources on micro-lending. The Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has shown us the way. A 50 dollar loan can sometimes do more good than a million dollars when you make sure it gets to the right place. We need to focus also on education in developing nations. 115 million of the world's children -- 60% of them girls -- do not receive any schooling. In too many countries, a virtual apartheid exists, where women are frozen out of the workforce and civic life. Unleashing the economic power of women through education can be the silver bullet that makes every problem easier to fight. I commend the efforts of the ONE Campaign, which is increasing awareness of the effects of AIDS and extreme poverty on developing nations. The ONE Campaign is asking the United States to double our development assistance to 2% of our federal budget. I wholeheartedly support this goal, and as President I will work to make it a reality. Our aid efforts must be guided by the principles of good governance and protection of human rights. As hard as we fight to fulfill the expectations that we have for ourselves ... we have the obligation to expect beneficiary nations to live up to these enduring values. The second part of our global initiative, will be to take immediate, bold steps toward clean energy. The foundation for our international action will be my comprehensive energy program, which the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation voters have called the most aggressive of any candidate for the Presidency. We should start by instituting a nation-wide, market-based cap and trade system that reduces carbon emissions in the US by 80% by 2040. We must lead the world in the development of clean, alternative energy, and we must work with other governments and private business to make sure that these technologies are adopted worldwide. Above all, we need to make sure that China and India develop using clean energy. In my upcoming book, "Leading by Example," I outline a specific and comprehensive path domestically and internationally to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stop the devastation of climate change. We need to accelerate research into cellulosic ethanol and other low-carbon input bio-fuels, and we need to construct distribution networks so that retailers can offer ethanol and bio-based fuels alongside traditional fuels. As the mandatory national emission cap declines, the market will decide which fossil fuel uses are no longer efficient or should be converted to new technologies. I am already working on a regional cap and trade system in the West, along with Governor Schwarzenegger and other governors. This system will limit the amount of greenhouse gasses. George Bush doesn't follow the Kyoto Protocols, but my state is on track to. Along the way to making New Mexico the Clean Energy State, I've learned some lessons. The most important is that Americans are ready to act. All they need is a President who is ready to lead. Once you lead, you find allies in corners that you never knew existed. Businesses. Non-profits. Activists. Former enemies and future friends. We can build the first true global coalition since America united the world to defeat the communism. The third part of my plan is introducing Republicans to a basic reality. The United Nations is a necessary and important framework for building the international cooperation that will be necessary to confront problems like environmental degradation and poverty. We must reform and invigorate it. As a former UN ambassador, I more than anyone in this race understand the shortcomings of that institution. I've worked to solve them. And I also know the incredible power that the legitimacy of international cooperation can lend to peacekeeping. To humanitarian relief. To addressing climate change. And to economic development. International cooperation will not always succeed, but cowboy diplomacy will almost always fail. We need to work with others now, through existing UN mechanisms, to prepare for the possibility that millions of people could be displaced as a result of global-warming-related flooding of deltas and costal areas. We also must prepare to shift infrastructure and food production to new regions. We will develop crops that are more resistant to heat and drought, and distribute these new crop strains to vulnerable regions of the world. We must develop cost-effective methods for harvesting fresh water and cleaning up polluted rivers and streams. We need aggressive reforestation programs and protection of tropical rainforests. And we need to develop new international treaties to prevent over-fishing and species loss. Fourth, my 21st Century Marshall Plan will fight cross-border crime. Sophisticated criminal networks running black market trade in arms, drugs, endangered species, counterfeit goods, and human beings threaten the security of us all. We must end slavery forever. Financial assistance to developing nations should be tied to swift and solid progress toward the eradication of human trafficking. And the United States needs to show the world that it can be done by ending slavery here in the US -- where an estimated 50,000 women and children are trafficked each year. It is unacceptable and I will direct the necessary efforts to end it. The US also must step up our efforts in the fight against global disease. I have proposed unprecedented increases in medical research. One of the great contributions the United States has made, should make, and will make again when I am President ... is to discover new cures to humanity's great afflictions. Cancer, heart disease, malaria, AIDS, TB -- all can and must be defeated. Religion today too often tears us apart. But poverty is a case where every single religion on the face of the planet should be able to unite. I refuse to believe that there is a person on this Earth that is not disgusted by the fact that a child born in Swaziland can only expect to live half as long as a child born in the United States. If we cannot lead global action based on this universal agreement, then we are not worthy of the great traditions of human dignity upon which this nation was founded. As we gather our strength for this effort, we must remember that preserving your popularity is no recipe for inspiring a nation, let alone the world. I owe my success in bringing people together and solving problems to taking risks. Sometimes you have to lay things on the line to get results. I recall when one of my constituents was taken hostage in Sudan. He was an American journalist from my own state and he was captured with two aides from the African nation of Chad. They were imprisoned on phony charges of espionage -- I had no reason to be optimistic about their release. But the journalist's wife asked me to go and try to get him out. So I went. The dictator of that country -- al-Bashir -- he said: "You can have the American, but the other two from Chad -- they stay." At this point I could have left with the American, but I said "No. I am bringing them all out." It was not the easy choice but it was the right choice. We went back into the negotiation and I left with all three men. There was no time then for polls or consultants. Nor is this a time for political calculation. We cannot afford leadership that has not been tested. My colleagues in this race have my respect, but it is a simple fact that the next international deal negotiated by any one of them will be their first. We also cannot afford another President who doesn't understand that stubborness is not strength. Consultation with friends, coordination with allies -- and negotiation with enemies -- is not weakness. It is what you need to do to get things done. It is the basis for restoring America's international leadership. I ask all Americans to join me in rebuilding our global leadership. Together we need: The compassion to commit the necessary resources. The courage to stand fast in the face of inevitable setbacks. And the faith to return to American principles ... Equality. Freedom. Human dignity. These are the values that every American has inherited. Let us be worthy of them. Thank you. Thank you for being with me. Thank you to NDN for hosting us here. Before I talk about Latin America, I want to take a few moments to talk about what is going on here in this state. These are tough times for Californians. They are tough times for all Americans. The fires that have ravaged this state ... have ravaged the national consciousness. Brave men and women are working day and night to end the devastation. Fire fighters continue to risk their own lives ... to protect the lives of their fellow Americans. In this sea of destruction, we can see reflected the courageous will that defines our nation. We must each step up and do what we can. Yesterday, my campaign donated ten thousand dollars to the Red Cross to assist relief efforts. I encourage all of you to give as much as possible, as soon as possible. I also ordered two strike teams of New Mexico fire fighters to assist in protecting against the fires here. I know that these fine New Mexicans will reflect the very best of our state's fire fighting tradition. Please take good care of them. In addition, it is clear that we need more air resources, so that we can be better positioned to handle these fires and better prepared to handle any other crises. I recall, in another disaster, when I led an effort in New Mexico to help out victims of hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. I remember going out to meet the first plane of refugees and you can feel so helpless in the presence of people that have lost everything. We did what a state can do. New Mexico has experienced the devastation and tragedy of huge wildfires and we know well the toll it takes on families and communities. On a national level, I believe that we need to reform our military to ensure that our National Guard system is never stretched to the breaking point again. At the same time that I was ordering New Mexico fire fighters to California, the President deployed three hundred of my state's National Guardsmen to Iraq. This is not what the National Guard was designed for. The war is leaving our homeland vulnerable to natural disasters. We have to end the war and get all our troops out as soon as possible. As President, I will get all the troops out within a year after I take office. And I'm going to add fifty thousand troops to the active-duty Army and Marine Corps, so that the Guard can protect Americans right here at home. Finally, we must honor the first responders who are fighting the fires right now. We must make sure that they have the best equipment, the best health care, and the best benefits for their families. They deserve nothing less. I deeply believe that the coming days will prove that even the greatest natural destruction ... is no match for the hopeful will of the American people. We will put the pieces back together. We will rebuild people's homes. Together, we will do it. Today, I want to talk with you about our foreign policy in our own hemisphere. It is painfully clear that George Bush's disastrous invasion of Iraq has wrecked our international credibility. It has damaged our alliances, emboldened our enemies, depleted our treasury, exhausted our armed forces and fueled global anger against us. The war continues to divert us from the real war against the terrorists who attacked us on 9-11. And it has undermined our ability to lead the world on pressing issues such as nuclear proliferation and global warming. Less discussed, but just as important is that the great damage caused by Iraq has extended even to our own back yard, in Latin America. George Bush's cowboy diplomacy has not just led us to ignore urgent challenges in our own region, but has alienated our friends in this hemisphere. As was so evident when Mr. Bush toured Latin America last March, anti-Americanism is growing at an alarming rate across the region. Through neglect we have turned many of our natural allies into fair-weather friends and outright enemies. The President once vowed to treat Latin America ''not as an afterthought, but as a fundamental commitment." But, despite Latin America's economic and national-security importance to the United States, he has neglected to engage the region. This policy of negligence is dangerous, and it cannot continue. We need bold action to repair the damage. The next President must have a clear plan for engagement, and the experience to implement it. As President, I will focus on seven strategies to rebuild our relationship with the rest of our hemisphere. At all times, we must preserve our faith in American values and renew our courage to connect with other nations. First, diplomacy! We must engage all Latin American countries diplomatically -- including troublesome regimes like Venezuela. This does not mean making concessions. It means honest talk and tough negotiation. It means trying to find common ground where we can and strengthening our interests where we can't. Second, we need a realistic approach towards Cuba. Currently our policy with regard to Cuba has been static and reactive. What we need is a vibrant and pro-active policy that deals sensibly with economic and personal issues like trade and family visitation.. President Bush has been imposing severe restrictions on family visits and remittances to Cuba. I strongly oppose these cruel and counterproductive rules. Cuban-Americans should be allowed to visit their families, and they should be able to help them out financially. The Bush administration even denied US Army Sergeant Carlos Lazo, who had won the Bronze Star in Iraq, permission to visit his two sons living in Cuba. That is appalling. Family values must mean actually valuing families. Furthermore, these restrictions bolster Castro's ability to portray himself as standing up to the big bully in Washington. Put simply, these rules have been good for Castro and bad for Americans and Cubans. As President, I will allow unimpeded family visits and remittances by Cuban-Americans to their relatives in Cuba. I will work with the Cuban-American community to heal the bitter divide that inevitably cuts through this issue. Together, we can create a policy that is good for all Americans. And I am ready to reassess the trade embargo ... in exchange for Cuba releasing all political prisoners and making positive moves towards democratic freedoms. Third, we should push for a Latin American country to have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile are obvious potential choices. Fourth, human rights. We need to replace inflammatory rhetoric about "regime change" with real promotion of human and democratic freedoms. Latinos admire American democratic values, but they know hypocrisy and they've seen it. Guantanamo. Abu Ghraib. Secret prisons. Torture. Let me be clear: I will be a President who follows the Constitution. And I will not only talk about human rights, I will be guided by a strong faith in the universal value of human dignity. Fifth, fair trade. We must promote trade agreements that include strong and enforceable labor, environmental, and human rights standards. Free and fair trade can benefit both Latin American and US workers. It will benefit consumers throughout the region. And it will bind closer the nations of the entire hemisphere. Sixth, development. We must lead the hemisphere in promoting economic development and reducing poverty. In an interdependent world, extreme poverty in one nation is the concern of all nations. Strong and equitable economic growth in Latin America is in the US national interest. It must be a priority. Those who think we can keep poor immigrants out with walls ... do not understand the desperate will of starving men and women. Therefore, seventh, we need comprehensive immigration reform that is realistic and humane. We need to aggressively police the border and punish employers who hire undocumented workers. But we must also recognize that we simply can't deport the twelve million who are already here. We need a tough, fair path to legalization. Our loftiest ideals are not inconsistent with our most realistic policy objectives. And after so many years of a foreign policy that has ignored both principles and pragmatism, we need a new kind of realism. This New Realism will go beyond the old, balance-of-power politics of the Cold War. We need to understand that what goes on in other countries affects us profoundly, and that skillful American diplomatic leadership is needed to meet the challenges of an age of interdependence. An age of global warming. Of global terrorism. Of global pandemics. We need to lead with skill and moral credibility. Across a wide range of economic, cultural and political issues, our future prosperity and security is tightly interwoven with that of all the peoples of the Americas. Venezuela is our fourth largest oil supplier, providing 15 percent of our annual oil consumption. Mexico is the third largest market for US-grown wheat, corn, cotton and soybeans. Small Central American countries such as Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras are major suppliers of the fresh fruit Americans eat, and Argentina, Ecuador, and Peru are top ten vegetable suppliers. The President just doesn't get it. He seems to think that Latin goodwill towards the United States is something we can take for granted. He seems to think that the fact of our geography guarantees the fitness of our relationship. And he continues to believe that region will somehow follow a nation that refuses to lead. They will not. In the absence of principled leadership from us, they will turn elsewhere ... anywhere ... to whoever steps up. Hugo Chávez of Venezuela has had serious success nourishing anti-US anger throughout the hemisphere. Chávez enhances his own power by using our country as his whipping boy. Like his friend, President Ahmadinejad of Iran, he thrives on conflict and incendiary rhetoric. Make no mistake: his gains are secured at our expense. We need a President who understands international politics and knows how to respond effectively to lies and provocations. When I am President, I will stand up for this country not by returning insults, but by exposing distortions. We need to take leaders like Chavez seriously, not because they are truthful -- they are not. We need to take them seriously because they are tapping into real resentment against us, and then amplifying it for their own purposes. Across the world, the Bush foreign policy has intensified anti-Americanism and played into the hands of our worst enemies. The Bush administration's short-sighted, clumsy diplomacy has helped leaders like Chávez and Castro create an axis of anti-American nationalism across the region. With the benefit of Venezuela's oil wealth, Chávez has forged ties with leaders such as Evo Morales in Bolivia and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. These four countries -- Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, and Nicaragua -- have formed a trade agreement that seeks to exclude and undermine US influence in Latin America. Chávez is reaching out to long-standing US partners such as Argentina. His trade and economic development proposals are filling the void left by our bankrupt leadership in the region. In recent years, Venezuela has purchased more than $5 billion worth of Argentine government bonds and other debt relief instruments. A few months ago, Argentina's President Nestor Kirchner met with Chávez and Evo Morales in Bolivia, where progress was made on a deal to ship more than $15 billion worth of Bolivian natural gas to Argentina. The Chávez method of "checkbook diplomacy" extends to the aid he provided to Peru following that country's catastrophic earthquake in August. Hundreds of people were killed ... thousands more displaced. The nation looked to the US for help. And yet, it was Venezuela that responded with more aid than the Bush administration. We handed Chávez yet another public relations coup in the region. I focus on Hugo Chávez not because he is the disease in Latin America, but because he is yet another symptom. The disease is arrogance. The next President must take a far more realistic look at what is needed to restore US standing in our own hemisphere. We need a President who understands the region and can talk directly to all the players. And I can speak in Spanish when needed. Yo hablo el idioma de la diplomacia. I know such direct engagement can work. I've sat down with Fidel Castro and negotiated the release of Cuban political prisoners. The Organization of American States has asked me to serve as special envoy for hemispheric affairs -- to help renew relations with our friends and restart talks with our foes. Only serious dialogue on issues such as immigration and trade can lead to serious solutions and a serious relationship with Latin America. We must remember that preserving your popularity is no recipe for inspiring a nation, let alone a region or a world. I owe my success in bringing people together and solving problems to taking risks. Sometimes you have to lay things on the line to get results. I recall when one of my constituents was taken hostage in Sudan. He was an American journalist from my own state and he was captured with two aides from the African nation of Chad. They were imprisoned on phony charges of espionage -- I had no reason to be optimistic about their release. But the journalist's wife asked me to go and try to get him out. So I went. The dictator of that country -- al-Bashir -- he said: "You can have the American, but the other two from Chad -- they stay." At this point I could have left with the American, but I said "No. I am bringing them all out." It was not the easy choice but it was the right choice. We went back into the negotiation and I left with all three men. There was no time then for polls or consultants. Nor is this a time for political calculation. We cannot afford leadership that has not been tested. My colleagues in this race have my respect, but it is a simple fact that the next international deal negotiated by any one of them will be their first. We also cannot afford another President who doesn't understand that stubbornness is not strength. Consultation with friends, coordination with allies -- and negotiation with enemies -- is not weakness. It is what you need to do to get things done. It is the basis for restoring America's international leadership. The Bush administration has missed too many opportunities to strengthen US engagement. Over and over, the President has failed to address urgent issues -- especially, trade, development and immigration. This "iron triangle" of concerns is tightly welded, and we need a comprehensive vision to tackle them. At its root, illegal immigration is an economic problem, driven by the lack of decent jobs for people in their home countries. So long as other economies fail to produce jobs, people will continue to come here. As long as we have a monopoly on hope, we will be a magnet for the hopeful. If we want to stop illegal immigration, we need to promote equitable development in Latin America. There is no way around it. We need trade agreements that create good jobs in all countries, including our own, while promoting human and worker's rights. We need a comprehensive immigration solution in this country -- one that includes a path to legalization. Part of that is increased border enforcement with smarter technology and more guards. It works. But you know what won't work? This wall. I think that Senators Clinton, Obama, and Biden were wrong to vote to build a wall between the United States and its neighbors. They talk about change. But they voted for the most blatant example of old-style Washington solutions-- expensive, dumb, and entirely the product of political calculation. They only funded half the wall. Anyone outside the beltway could tell you how well half a wall works. What's next? Funding for half of a dam? Half an airplane? Half a withdrawal from Iraq? Apparently the people in Washington who want to build a 12 foot wall have never heard of 13 foot ladders. We need new thinking in the White House, the kind that would never allow such a symbol along our border. If your Latin America policy starts with a wall between cultures ... it will quickly collapse into rubble. We need new thinking in the White House on immigration and trade. Unfortunately, the indifference of the Bush administration has enabled Chavez and others to convince many Latinos that expanded trade with the US is bad for Latin America. The good news is that there are real opportunities to build mutually-beneficial trade and development partnerships with Latin American countries. We can have trade agreements that are good for workers, companies, and nations. Agreements that create jobs, fight poverty, and reduce the incentives for people to emigrate illegally to the United States. Other countries are already taking advantage of our missed opportunities. China's trade with Latin America has doubled in just the past six years. The US needs to get off the sidelines and back into the game. It means jobs -- here in the U.S. and in Latin America. We also need to recognize that for many years to come the US economy will continue to attract Latino workers. While our laws say they cannot come here, our economy says they should. We need to be realistic. . Our economy demands these workers, and it makes no sense to have them here illegally rather than legally. As we crack down on illegal immigration, we need to allow more legal immigration. We need a reasonable guest-worker program, and an earned path to legalization for those already here. And we need to work with the Mexican government to get them to stop encouraging illegal immigration ... and instead to start creating more jobs in Mexico. We also need a more effective approach to the problem of illegal drugs. Recent action in Congress would reduce the emphasis on military intervention, and would increase US support for rural development, judicial reform, and law enforcement assistance programs. This is a needed step in the right direction. Our military cannot solve every problem by itself. As with illegal immigration, we need to recognize that drugs are a development and economic incentive issue. Law enforcement is essential, but it is not enough. To fight drug trafficking, we need to arrest and punish dealers, but we also need to fight the profitability of the trade itself. We need to do more to reduce demand at home I learned this in New Mexico. As we shut down over 400 meth labs, reducing supply ... we also undermined demand by providing quality drug treatment to break the addiction cycle. And we must remember that a farmer who can make a living doing something legal, is far less likely to choose drugs production. A worker with a good job is less likely to fall into the clutches of drug smugglers. Stronger Latin American economies will be less vulnerable to drug lords. Finally, we cannot truly engage Latin America if we do not include the the 28 million indigenous peoples who live there. Too many indigenous peoples live in deep poverty. Too many lack access to the essential services that others in their own countries take for granted. Too many are ignored by their own governments. It is essential that our policies respect indigenous traditions and promote the rights of indigenous peoples. After years of neglect and missed opportunities, the President's trip last March to Latin America was too little, too late. The next administration must do better. We will need a renewed commitment to Latin America based upon engagement, dialogue, and cooperation. We need equitable trade agreements, and comprehensive immigration reform. Having spent part of my childhood in Mexico, and having traveled widely in the region, I understand the complicated dynamics of inter-American relations. My Mexican mother taught me to value and respect Latino culture, just as my American father made me so proud to be a citizen of the United States. My autobiography was titled "Between Worlds," not because we are worlds apart, but rather because we are so close -- and because it is so important that we work together toward common goals. Woody Allen once said that eighty percent of success is showing up. These recent years, we have not shown up in Latin America. Instead, we've been shown up by lesser leaders. That must change. If we do not attempt to succeed in the region, then surely we will fail. Moving forward, we must preserve the shared faith of the people of this hemisphere ... in the principles of human dignity and democratic freedoms. We must have the simple courage to be strong. We must step up and lead. Muchas gracias -thank you very much. Thank you so much for having me. It is an honor to be with you and especially to be with the veterans and military families who have joined us here today. Thank you for your service to our nation. When the President asks our military men and women to put themselves in harm's way halfway around the world, we do not expect hesitation. We expect the honorable chorus of "Yes, sir, yes ma'am ... for flag, for country, for the defense of freedom." We expect that while we tend to the everyday business of our native soil, there are those who have chosen a different path. There are those who will leave their families to protect ours. There are those that carry the proud promise of a righteous defense ... passed down from Valley Forge to Iwo Jima to Inchon to Hue to today in the mountains of Afghanistan and the deserts of Iraq. This solemn tradition of service has stood unbroken for nearly a quarter millennium. Not simply because of a shared uniform or joint drills. This tradition is bonded by a common faith that human dignity and democratic freedoms are worth fighting for. This promise of protection is kept alive by generations of courageous servicemen and women. It is a promise that does not and should not come cheap. When our troops salute and ship out overseas, they are keeping their promise of service to our nation. It's about time we kept our nation's promise to them. It's about time that we said: Yes soldier, yes sailor, yes airman, yes marine ... you and your family are entitled to the best health care. The best benefits. To the best our nation has to offer. President Bush has failed again and again to keep up his part of this promise. While asking for more and more from our troops and their families ... he has given them less and less. And his failures are even more insidious because they are too often unseen. The President has blocked out pictures of the flag-draped coffins coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq. We do not see our maimed vets marching in parades -- only in the occasional news exposé of decrepit conditions. By now we've all seen the disgraceful conditions at Walter Reed. But too few of us have heard about the mental trauma suffered by so many returning combat veterans. Too few have felt the anxiety of military families across the country that can't make ends meet while a loved one is serving abroad. Put simply, the President has hidden away the heroism of our fighting men and women. He has traded in our troops' health care for tax cuts, and he has traded on our veterans' service for votes. It's long past time that ended. It's long past time we said: Never in America. Never again. It is the sacred duty of any Commander-in-Chief to take care of his or her troops. And I swear to you that when I am President, I will not rest until the promise we've made to our veterans and our military families is fulfilled. The first step is getting all of our troops out of Iraq. All our troops, with no residual forces left behind. Only when we make it clear that we are leaving can we expect the Iraqis to make the tough choices necessary for reconciliation. Only when all of our troops are on their way out, will others in the region do what they must to prevent Iraq from collapsing. Only our departure will give us the credibility to convene a Dayton-style conference to build a power-sharing arrangement policed by multilateral, UN-sanctioned peacekeepers. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards have said we have to wait and see how things go before we can know how many troops to bring out and how quickly. I say there has been enough waiting and seeing. If you haven't seen enough to know that we need to get all the troops out then you aren't watching the same war that I and the rest of America are seeing. Senators Clinton and Obama -- when directly asked -- refused to commit to getting all U.S. troops out by 2013. Tens of thousands could remain in Iraq through 2013 -- and Senator Clinton said she might have troops in Iraq at the end of her second term. Leaving troops is just changing the mission -- we need to end this war and while I respect my Democratic colleagues, their plans simply will not end this war. How many more mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, wives, husbands, and children must lose their loved ones before we get our troops out of the crossfire? How many more of our young people will die before we recognize that our troops cannot win someone else's civil war? Over 3,800 brave Americans have lost their lives. More than 60,000 have been wounded. Countless more suffer the lonely anguish of mental trauma. Yet, the administration has shut its eyes to the scars and closed its ears to the cries for help. It is absolutely unacceptable. Our veterans fought the enemy abroad. They should not have to fight their government at home to get the health care they have earned over and over again. Today, almost 2 million veterans are uninsured. That is not right. When I am President, all veterans will be offered a Heroes' Health Card. If it's inconvenient for them to get to a VA hospital or clinic, you know where they can get care? Wherever they need it. While we expand choice, we also need to make sure that the VA system is the strongest it can be. I will guarantee full mandatory funding for the VA. No more year-to-year, discretionary funding. No more political calculation. No more games. The health of our veterans is not optional. The funding must be mandatory. When we send our troops into harm's way, we do not ask how much it will cost. When they come home wounded, we should not ask, ‘How much will that cost?' The answer to both questions is the same. Whatever it takes. It is essential that we fix Walter Reed and the rest of our military hospitals. The conditions that we saw at Walter Reed were an insult to our veterans and an embarrassment to our nation. The President should have stood up and taken responsibility. He should have said: "The buck stops with me. This will be fixed." He didn't. Instead we saw another game of Washington musical chairs. And when the music stopped, the President scrambled to find himself a comfortable place to sit, well out of the way. Well, when I am President I will never sit back and watch our veterans suffer. I will require a regular briefing from the military's senior medical general officer on the status of our nation's medical facilities. I will stand up ... out front ... every day for our fighting men and women and their families. We all know that when our troops ship out, they do not serve alone. Their families serve with them. And the power of our military is a testament to the strength of our military families. When our troops come home wounded, they cannot heal alone. We must support the families that care for our veterans. Our resolve to support these families bears witness to the character of our nation. Often, spouses and parents are forced to leave their jobs in order to care for a wounded troop. As President, I will offer a comprehensive disability insurance policy that will average forty thousand dollars. It will cover the necessary expenses for the next of kin when a spouse, parent, or other family member stays by the side of a wounded veteran during the recovery process. I will offer up to a year of paid leave, to ensure the financial stability of the families of recovering veterans. And we must recognize that not all injuries can be treated with bandages and stents. Mental trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury. These are battlefield injuries. We cannot ignore them just because we can't see them on a soldier or marine's body. There should be an automatic presumption that mental illnesses are service related. Indeed, we need to revamp our entire veterans' disability system. Today, we have a system that has been designed to protect the financial interests of the government rather than address the medical conditions of our veterans. That is wrong. A veteran who has served honorably should not have to prove he or she is entitled to care. Rather, the burden of proof should be on the government to meet its obligations, and to meet them as fully and honorably as our veterans have met theirs. All of them ... all who have served have committed themselves to the protection of our nation. Many have risked their lives over and over again. And I believe that we, as a nation, have a lifelong duty to our veterans. As President, I will reduce federal income taxes by five percent for all veterans for the rest of their lives. Senator Jim Webb -- one of our nation's greatest veterans -- is exactly right on this issue, and I will fight for his proposal. I will also eliminate federal income taxes for all troops in their first year out of the military. It is our responsibility to ease the frequently-difficult transition from military to civilian life. President Bush cut taxes for our nation's wealthiest citizens. I will cut taxes for our nation's bravest citizens. I've already done it in New Mexico. We eliminated the state income tax for all active-duty military pay. I led the nation by purchasing a 400,000 dollar life insurance premium for each and every member of the New Mexico National Guard. 18 other states have followed our lead. Guard personnel and their families around the country are now much better protected against the worst. I granted free tuition to any New Mexico public university for any child of a New Mexican Guardsman killed in action. Education is the spark that lights minds. And the GI Bill was the fuse to the economic explosion that powered our nation through the last century. When I am President, I will fight for a new GI Bill for the 21st century. My national service plan will augment the GI Bill and the Services' College Funds with additional funding for college and career education -- up to 24,000 dollars in loan forgiveness. Furthermore, my plan will allow a spouse or child to use these benefits, if the service member doesn't. And I will make sure that all service members get the benefits that they've earned. What's happened to the Iowa National Guard is outrageous. But, it is a perfect example of how this Administration talks about supporting the troops ... and then denies them the benefits they deserve. The men and women of the Iowa Guard served the longest tour of any combat unit in Iraq. Their deployment was extended not once, but twice. Some were on active duty for 729 days. Yet, when they returned home the Administration told them: "Sorry. You're one day short of getting your full benefits." One day short. This is unconscionable. It is disgraceful. It is just plain wrong. While I am glad Congressman Braley and others are working hard to fix this problem for these veterans, when I am President I will make sure that this never happens again for any veterans. I will count all days -- both at home and abroad -- that Guard and Reserve personnel serve on active duty during wartime toward their cumulative total of days served. It is enough that they have served these days -- they should not have to serve them consecutively. I will also guarantee ... that employers give mobilized members of the Guard and Reserve their old jobs back. No questions asked. And we've got to help small businesses do their part. I will offer a tax credit for small businesses who go the extra mile and help make up the difference in pay for Guard and Reserve personnel called to active-duty. One in seven American businesses is owned by a veteran. I will fully implement those provisions of the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 -- including federal contracts set-asides -- which help support our vet-owned businesses. These issues are not new to me. I have spent my career fighting for our troops, our veterans, and our military families. It has been my privilege to stand with those who have stood against our enemies. It has been my honor to stand with those who have stood up for our values generation after generation. And it has been my determination to make life better for our veterans wherever I have served. I owe my success in bringing people together and solving problems to taking risks. Sometimes you have to lay things on the line to get results. I have negotiated with some of the toughest dictators in the world and come home successful. I went to North Korea earlier this year on a bipartisan mission. I came home with the remains of six soldiers Missing in Action since the Korean War. I've negotiated the release of American servicemen and civilians from Iraq, North Korea, and Cuba. I recall when one of my constituents was taken hostage in Sudan. He was an American journalist from my own state and he was captured with two aides from the African nation of Chad. They were imprisoned on phony charges of espionage -- I had no reason to be optimistic about their release. But the journalist's wife asked me to go and try to get him out. So I went. The dictator of that country -- al-Bashir -- he said: "You can have the American, but the other two from Chad -- they stay." At this point I could have left with the American, but I said "No. I am bringing them all out." It was not the easy choice but it was the right choice. We went back into the negotiation and I left with all three men. There was no time then for polls or consultants. Nor is this a time for political calculation. I am going to use the same words I used then when I communicate with our troops in Iraq as their Commander-in-Chief: "I am bringing you all out." No one must be left behind to fight someone else's civil war. And the next President must state unequivocally and without reservation that torture cannot and will not be a part of our foreign policy. Torture subverts the effectiveness of our intelligence. It sabotages our moral authority in the world. And it sacrifices the safety of our troops. As President, I will shut down the prison at Guantanamo. I will follow the Geneva Conventions. And I will preserve, protect, and uphold the Constitution of the United States. Let us be worthy of the service that our veterans and military families have given to this nation. Let us know that when an American troop is wounded, our nation is wounded. For he or she has sacrificed to protect what we all hold dear. When an American troop dies, a piece of us all is lost forever. For they have given all in the defense of our shared values. In recent years, too many pieces have been lost forever. Today, too many wounds remain open. Together, I know that we can do better. Thank you again to all the veterans and military families here for your generous and honorable service. I hope you will join me in fulfilling our nation's obligations to veterans and military families across this great country. I hope you will join me in honoring those who have given so honorably. Thank you. Thanks so much for joining me here today. It's good to be back in Iowa, in the heartland of America. Nearly sixty years ago a great son of the heartland, Harry Truman, said that "Every segment of our population, and every individual, has a right to expect from our government a fair deal." As I travel around Iowa, it is clear that America's family farmers have not forgotten those words. They have not forgotten that every American deserves a fair deal. A fair deal on the food we eat. A fair deal on the new energy that will keep our environment clean. A fair deal on maintaining our land and water. Unfortunately under this President, our government has not held up its end of the deal. Fairness has been corrupted by campaign financing. President Bush signed away the family farm to big agribusiness. We can do better. This President says he will protect our homeland. But he doesn't seem to understand that our land and water are threatened by pollution. He doesn't understand that the food we consume in this country is not always safe. We must do better. The President has promised to do something about the rising price of oil, but his only solution has been to give more money to the oil companies. He's ignored the promise of wind, solar, ethanol and bio-fuel -- energy that's produced not in Iran, but right here in Iowa. For our children, I know that we will do better. For fifty years, America's heartland has fed the world. Because of you, generations of foreign citizens have known America not only because we can fire missiles ... but also because we can feed children. Our farmers have made the case for American greatness through the soft power of sustenance. Now, in a new century, we face new challenges. Our addiction to foreign oil is hurting our economy and our standing in the world. We must break it. Global warming threatens the land that feeds us. The foundation for a whole way of life could soon melt away. We must reverse it. I know that Iowa's farmers stand ready to meet this energy challenge. With corn and soybeans, ethanol, biodiesel, wind and bio-mass ... you stand ready to lead the energy revolution we so desperately need. I also know that we cannot ask you to do it alone. The next President must be a partner. We need a new direction for American agriculture. One that seizes the opportunities presented by renewable fuel possibilities, that makes conservation a real priority, and levels the playing field for family farmers and independent producers. I will begin by listening to the words of President Truman. It's time we put fairness back into our farm policy. We're going to make sure that free markets and fair competition are the rule, not the exception. I'm going to prohibit excessive vertical and horizontal integration. Modern-day monopolies are just as unacceptable as Standard Oil was at the turn of the century. We need real enforcement of our anti-trust laws. I'm going to sign the Packer Ban. I'm going to close the loopholes in the Packers and Stockyards Act. And we have to ensure accurate and complete same-day reporting of all livestock sales. I'm going to put a hard cap of 250,000 dollars on direct subsidy payments to farmers ... and close the loopholes. As a nation, we should maximize support for family farms. And we need to make the most of our resources. The family farm has been the back bone of American agriculture for centuries ... and we need to make sure that family farms remain the back bone of American agriculture. Another important part of making the most of what we have ... is investing in conservation. Historically, America's farmers have not only been growers of food ... they have been stewards of our land and water. It is absolutely essential that we maintain that tradition of responsibility. I will fully fund and expand the Conservation Reserve Program, the Conservation Security Program, and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program. We need to reduce soil erosion and keep our water clean for future generations. And if we are serious about the future, then we have to get serious about clean energy. We need an energy revolution in this country ... and Iowa can lead it. The Sierra Club and the League of Conservation voters have called my energy plan ‘the most aggressive of all the candidates.' Rural America will be central to that plan. It's going to take a man-on-the-moon effort ... and sacrifice from every American. It's going to take Americans using energy-efficient appliances and taking mass transit where possible. Just as importantly, it's going to take faith from every American that we can do it. I know that, together, we can. I have a ten-to-twelve year crash program that moves us away from carbon-based to renewable energy sources. We can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by thirty percent by 2020 and eighty percent by 2040 ... and keep our environment intact. We can cut our dependence on foreign oil by fifty percent by 2020 by switching to electric and bio-fuels ... and make sure that we never send our kids to die in the Middle East again. We can build a new energy economy ... and create new, high-quality jobs in Rural America -- jobs that can never be outsourced. And when there are new economic opportunities in our rural communities, our young people will be able to remain in their communities, have careers and raise families. That's what we want. An excellent example of the vast potential for good rural jobs in the future is the Wind Energy and Turbine Technology programs at Iowa Lakes Community College. Those programs will help meet the growing demand for skilled technicians who can install, maintain, and service modern wind turbines. We know that the number of wind turbines in the state of Iowa is expected to double in the next twelve months alone. When I'm President, I will offer tax credits for alternative energy production, especially in ethanol, bio-fuels, wind, and solar. I will fund research into promising cellulosic ethanol and other bio-fuels. And I will incentivize the creation of an alternative energy infrastructure, like flex-fuel and plug-in pumps at gas stations. For the past fifty years, Iowa has been the world's breadbasket. In the next fifty, I believe that Iowa can also be the world's power generator. Hybrid seed corn is now being developed which promises substantially higher yields, and which can help us develop the equilibrium between food and fuel markets in Iowa. Farmers right here in America's heartland are working today to build a new energy economy. As President, I will be a partner in leading a new energy revolution. I know that we can do it because I've done it before. I've been the Secretary of Energy. As Governor, I made New Mexico the Clean Energy State. And we've done it while creating 80,000 new jobs and revitalizing our rural economy. I offered tax credits to companies that paid above the prevailing wage and created jobs in rural areas. Having run a state, I know that you can't just focus on the problems that the papers write about. Every community matters, whether it's big or small, urban or rural. And I have worked to solve the problems of all my state's people -- not just those in the big cities. I will bring that experience to the White House. I will offer a national rural jobs tax credit to make our rural economy strong. I also recognize that we cannot move forward as a nation, until every American community has a piece of the twenty-first century. I will ensure that we have universal broadband access throughout rural America. Tele-work holds enormous promise for new jobs in rural America and welcome economic diversity. I know that we can do all of these things because as I've travelled the country it has become clear to me that Americans are ready to act. What our country needs now is real leadership. I've spent my entire life bringing people together to get things done. I owe my success in solving problems to taking risks. Earlier in this campaign, I took some heat from the smarty-pants set in Washington for saying that Iowa should receive its fair share of anti-terrorism funding. I knew it wouldn't be an easy position to take ... but I thought it was clear that we need to protect our nation's food supply from terrorists. I still feel that way. When I'm President, we're going to beef up USDA inspections of our domestic foodstuffs, and we're going to get tough on food imported from foreign countries. I'm going to work to diversify our stocks of food species. And I'm going to make sure that we implement Country of Origin Labelling laws immediately. . I pledge to the American people that I will do whatever it takes to keep our food supply safe. So even though I took some heat ... I know it was the right thing to do. And sometimes you have to lay things on the line to get results. I remember when one of my constituents was taken hostage in Sudan. He was an American journalist from my own state and he was captured with two aides from the African nation of Chad. They were imprisoned on phony charges of espionage. I had no reason to be optimistic about their release. But the journalist's wife asked me to go and try to get him out. So I went. The dictator of that country -- al-Bashir -- he said: "You can have the American, but the other two from Chad -- they stay." At this point I could have left with the American, but I said "No. I am bringing them all out." It was not the easy choice but it was the right choice. We went back into the negotiation and I left with all three men. There was no time then for polls or consultants. And now is not the time for political calculation. Nor is this a time for the politics of negativity. You know, I haven't read all the other candidates' farm plans. But from what I can tell, they must think you guys have too much dirt out here ... because they're bringing a lot of it to back to the campaign trail and slinging it around at each other. I say: Let's keep the mud where it belongs. We cannot build America up by tearing each other down. Think of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. They don't serve as Democrats or as Republicans -- they serve as Americans. We have to do the same here at home ... to build a great American future. At the beginning of this race, I offered a pledge to campaign positively. I stand by that pledge. I refuse to attack anyone's character. That is not we need and I call on my colleagues to stop it. Winning an election is not worth sacrificing our principles. That does not mean we don't have policy differences -- and that's what we should be talking about. Our different visions for bringing peace to Iraq. On education. On energy. On stopping a war with Iran. Unfortunately, in Washington today there's too much negativity. Negativity over health care. Negativity over immigration. But when I travel around Iowa, I see something different. I am reminded again that we are a positive nation, founded on inspiring principles. I see a place where character is more than the contents of your bank account. Where leadership means more than a list of things you plan to do. Where your neighbor's word is more important than all the smooth talk in the world. I see a people who reward those who work hard; but also recognize that even the hardest workers cannot do it alone. I see a nation attached to our land, but rooted in our values. I have a vision of America in ascendancy. It's a vision that all our people, whether they are in blue, red our purple states can share. This is America. We landed a man on the moon. We built the internet. We beat the Great depression. We defeated the Nazis. We routed the Soviet Union in a global battle over the future of the planet. So my message for all those who are pessimists, those who are negative, those who are angry is this: We can do it. To those who said I couldn't get those hostages out of Sudan -- I said I can. And I did it. To those who say we can't get a fair deal for our family farmers -- I say we can. To those who say we can't we can't revitalize our rural economy -- I say we can. To those who say we can't conserve our land and water -- I say we can. To those who say we can't spark a new energy revolution -- I say we can. To those who engage in the politics of personal attacks -- I say we can do better. If we work together, we can solve our problems. We can. And we will. It's an honor to be with you. Thank you so much for having me here today. I come here today as a border state Governor, and a Hispanic-American who knows that our nation can no longer afford to ignore the issue of illegal immigration. I come here as a Democrat who believes my party has an obligation as the new majority party to pass comprehensive legislation to reform our immigration laws. And I come here as someone who believes it's time for our leaders to tell the simple truth about this -- and every other -- issue. Today, there are over 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Most are law abiding, except for the fact that they have entered this country illegally. And almost all have come here to work -- to build a better life for themselves and their families, just as previous generations of immigrants have done. Eleven million people living in the shadows is a huge problem, and we need to address it intelligently and thoughtfully -- and urgently. If Congress fails to do so, it will only get worse, and the demagoguery about it which we have heard so much of recently will only get louder. As the California-born son of an American father and a Mexican mother, I have known immigrants all my life and I know why they come to America. And as Governor of New Mexico I have known the problem of illegal immigration all too well -- we live with this issue every day in my state. Like it or not, these people have become part of the fabric of our economy and our culture. They have broken the law to enter our country, but they are here -- there are millions of them building and cleaning our homes and offices, picking and cooking our food, caring for our children. These men and women are here illegally, but they work hard, pay taxes, and contribute to the communities they live in. America needs to SOLVE this problem, not tear itself apart over it. I believe the American people are better than the demagogues think we are, and that the voters proved it on November 7th. The most extreme candidates lost across the country. Seventy percent of Hispanic citizens voted Democratic, and most non-Hispanics also rejected the divisive politics of the anti-immigrant extremists. I hope that the Republican right-wing learned its lesson and that sensible Senators and Congressmen from both parties can now come together and address this real problem with real solutions. I also hope that President Bush, whose rhetoric has been moderate on this issue, will now step up and lead a bipartisan comprehensive reform effort. Think for a moment about the quality of life for an undocumented worker. No protection from unscrupulous employers. No job benefits. No health care, no pension, no Social Security, no workers compensation, no Medicare or disability insurance. Yet -- despite what some people would have you think -- almost all of these workers pay taxes, including Social Security and Medicare taxes. Because in order to find work they must either use someone else's Social Security number or make one up. Since they will never collect benefits, these illegal workers are subsidizing our Social Security and Medicare trust funds with their payroll taxes. And those who are not paying into Social Security and Medicare are working under the table, and are at even greater risk of being exploited. No minimum wage, no safety standards, no over-time, no protection against sexual harassment or even sexual abuse. Many workers change jobs every few months because their employer finds out that their Social Security number is invalid or belongs to someone else. Most undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work low-wage jobs which few Americans want, such as picking crops or cleaning toilets. Our economy creates demand for at least 400,000 new low-skill illegal immigrants per year, but only about 140,000 are allowed to enter legally. When demand and legal supply are so out of line, the pressures for illegal immigration are enormous. And let's not forget what kind of lives the vast majority of illegal immigrants were living in their home countries -- what propels them to come here in the first place. Economic opportunity and upward mobility in Mexico and Central American countries are limited, and half of all Mexicans live in poverty and a fifth live in extreme poverty. When there are hundreds of thousands of relatively good paying new jobs available every year a few hundred miles to the north the result is completely predictable. Yes, we are talking about people who knowingly have broken the law. And they should be held accountable, like all lawbreakers. But we also are talking about people who are economic refugees, and who contribute significantly to America's economic success and to the economic and political stability of their home countries -- with the billions in remittances they send home to their families every year. If we're going to tell the truth we'll admit that entire sectors of our economy rely on these laborers -- construction, restaurants, and agriculture, for example. Without them, many American businesses simply could not continue to function. By some estimates, undocumented workers account for fully 2% of our national economy. 11 million lawbreakers is a daunting number - and more arrive every day. Such widespread disregard for the law is corrosive of our civic culture, and must not be allowed to continue. A nation of laws cannot allow millions of undocumented immigrants to live in the shadows and hundreds of thousands more to enter the country illegally every year. For decades politicians have passed laws on immigration with a wink and a nudge, with no intent of following through and making sure those laws were enforced. For far too long, the immigration debate has been about electoral politics, not about policy. We need more honest leadership than that. We need to stop exploiting the immigration problem, and start solving it. We need to pass realistic laws and then enforce them rigorously. Despite the campaign rhetoric, I refuse to believe that most House Republicans really favor trying to round up 11 million people, separating them from their children who are citizens, and deporting them en masse. But that's what the bill they passed in the House of Representatives on December 16, 2005 would require. Americans don't want that and I believe the results of the 2006 elections prove it. Only in a few races for local office in communities that have been dramatically transformed in recent years by illegal immigration was anybody defeated for public office because they supported a moderate approach to the problem. Certainly no congressional or gubernatorial candidate was defeated for that reason. I got almost 70 percent of the vote for Governor this year in New Mexico -- 15 percent more than in 2002 when I was first elected, and New Mexico is a swing state. This is after I implemented a policy to grant drivers licenses without regard to legal residency. As a result of this policy we got the percentage of uninsured drivers down from 31 percent to 12 percent. New Mexicans want our roads to be safe and the driver who rear-ends them to be insured. We want our highway cops to focus on catching drunk drivers, not illegal immigrants. The Federal government has failed to deal with illegal immigration, forcing state governors to deal with the consequences of this failure. Governors must promote public safety and ensure that all residents of the state--welcome or unwelcome, legally here or not--are productive, self-supporting, and law abiding contributors to our community. But treating illegal immigrants like human beings won't make the problem go away. We also need to face up to the problem, and that begins with better border security. Last year I declared a State of Emergency along our border with Mexico because the situation there had gotten out of hand. Nobody was addressing the issue in Washington, D.C., and crime, drugs and lawlessness were out of control. I also was the first Governor to meet President Bush's request to send National Guard troops to the border, because the situation is a national security concern as well. Al Qaeda took decades to find a way to hit America hard and terrorists are still out there, probing, plotting, and preparing for their next attack. I know that full well from my diplomatic experience. If there's a way for them to get into this country and attack us again they will find it. We need to stop them, and border security is essential to doing so. I believe in recognizing the reality of the immigration problem and addressing it head-on. I reject both the cheap rhetoric we heard in this year's campaign, AND I reject the fears of some Democrats that taking action will cause our party political harm. We should seek a bipartisan solution to the problem of illegal immigration, and I believe such a solution is at hand. We have a unique opportunity to deal with this issue in 2007 and if we let it pass we might not get another opportunity for years to come. Illegal immigration has doubled in the past ten years and if it is not addressed it could double again in the next ten years. Think of the demagoguery we will hear then! So I am calling on the Democratic Congress to act swiftly to work with the President and solve this problem. And it can be solved by taking four realistic steps -- securing the border, increasing legal immigration, preventing employers from hiring illegal workers, and providing a path to legalization for most of the 11 million illegal immigrants already here. Securing the border must come first -- but we must understand that building a fence will not in any way accomplish that objective. No fence ever built has stopped history and this one wouldn't either. The Congress should abandon the fence, lock, stock, and barrel. It flies in the face of America as a symbol of freedom. This is what we should do: immediately put enough National Guard troops at the border to keep it covered until we can secure it with Border Patrol officers. That should take no longer than three years. If it takes another year, let's do it. Second, we must hire and train enough Border Guards to actually cover the entire border. I have spent a lot of time at the border and I know we cannot secure it with a fence, but we can secure it with enough trained Border Patrol officers. I propose doubling the number of Border Patrol agents from approximately 12-thousand to 24-thousand. That would secure the border. And you could more than pay for it with the funding for the first segment of that ill-advised fence between, Mexico and the United States. Real security, real results, at a fraction of the financial or political cost. Third, we should give the Border Patrol the benefit of the best surveillance equipment available to our military. And, as suggested by Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a leader on immigration issues, we should implement a system of "informant visas" and cash rewards for aliens who provide law enforcement with information on human traffickers and document forgers. We should establish a "fraudulent documents task force" to constantly update law enforcement and border officials on the latest fraudulent documents being marketed for entry into the United States. Finally, we have to work closely with the Mexican government. Illegal immigration is, at its root, primarily an economic problem: Mexicans need jobs and incomes, and Mexico benefits greatly from illegal immigration to the United States. It is a safety valve for their unemployed, and a major source of revenue in their economy, from the money illegal workers here send home. Under present conditions, the Mexicans just don't have enough incentive to give us the help we need at the border. Mexico needs to do more to stem the flow. But if we create a reasonable guest worker program and provide a path to legalization for illegal immigrants already here -- as I will discuss in a moment -- there is every reason to expect Mexico to do its part to create more jobs in Mexico and to help us with border security. The Mexicans, after all, also suffer great harm from the lawlessness at the border, from drug smuggling and the simple misery of people trying again and again to get into the United States illegally. But don't expect the Mexican government to do anything if we're going to talk about building a Berlin-style wall and deporting millions of Latinos. Two weeks ago I met with Mexican President Calderon and he told me he is willing to do work with us to stop illegal immigration -- if the United States is willing to address the crisis honestly and realistically along with him. If we refrain from building the fence (which, as I have said, is a waste of money anyway), I believe that the Mexicans would to step in with real efforts to help us patrol the border more effectively. We need to build a special relationship with our neighbor to the south, so that we can jointly patrol the border, and work together on creating more jobs for Mexicans at home in Mexico. President Bush needs to address this issue with Mexico aggressively and realistically. He needs to use his last two years to turn President Calderon's good intentions into good efforts. One of the reasons for my meeting with President Calderon was to pitch a plan to develop border infrastructure to move goods through the free-trade zones along the border, revitalizing communities on both sides of the border and creating much-needed jobs. This kind of action takes face-to-face diplomacy- something this country has been far too reluctant to engage in lately. I believe many problems can be solved by facing them head-on, face-to-face. My entire career has been based largely on that principle. Earlier today, I was very proud to stand with Secretary General Insulza of the organization of American States, who has appointed me as a Special Envoy to the OAS for Hemispheric Relations. I will work on special assignments in Latin America at the request of the Secretary, with a special focus on economic development and immigration. It would be my goal to demonstrate to OAS member states that they have an equal responsibility to solve the immigration problem, and work together on many important issues. Once the border is secure we must make it possible for employers to meet legally their unskilled labor needs. Raising the minimum wage to $7.50 dollars an hour will motivate more Americans to fill some of these jobs, but most low-wage jobs will still need to be filled by immigrants -- because there simply are not enough Americans who want them. If the US economy needs these workers, it is in our national interest to let more of them come legally, by increasing combined legal quotas for temporary and permanent taxpaying immigrants to 400,000 workers per year. To keep families together, we also should double the number of family member visas, from 480,000 to 960,000. We also need to improve the efficiency and transparency of our legal immigration machinery, which is plagued by long delays and huge backlogs. We need clearer procedures and more rapid and efficient processing of immigration petitions, so that fewer people will seek to evade the legal process, and more can be admitted legally. The McCain-Kennedy legislation passed by the Senate this year provided an excellent framework for a guest worker program: pay an application fee, undergo a medical examination and a background check, the initial work period would be three years and it could be extended for up to three more years, if you're out of work for more than 45 days you must return to your home country or last country of residence, you can change employers, but if you break the law you must leave. Those are realistic and sustainable requirements. The number of guest workers allowed at any one time must be based upon the needs of the US economy. The goal must be to meet demand for jobs that go unfilled by American citizens, and no more. Increasing the minimum wage will help, but we must make certain that no American loses a job because of a guest worker program. Enforcement of our minimum wage laws also must improve: any employer who pays less than the minimum wage to any worker must face both high fines and a high probability of getting caught. We also must expand employment-training for low-wage American workers. We also need a national system to reliably and instantaneously verify the legal status of every job applicant and worker. We cannot stop illegal immigration if we continue to look the other way on illegal employment. We need a national, non-duplicable electronic worker identification document to be used exclusively for employment purposes. Such a system must come with legal protections against it being used to discriminate in hiring practices, as well as privacy safeguards. After the institution of such an ID system, employers will have no excuses: those who knowingly hire undocumented workers must face serious and certain penalties. Those who hire illegal immigrants are law-breakers too, and like illegal immigrants themselves, they must be held to account for breaking the law. Finally, there is the question of the status of the 11 million illegal immigrants who are here today. The legislation passed last December by the Republican House of Representatives was a monument to demagoguery. It actually proposed making felons of 11 million people and rounding them up for deportation. Clearly, this would be impossible to do. The number of illegal immigrants is five times the number of inmates in all American prisons combined. Our economy could not stand the shock of losing all these workers, and our national conscience would not countenance arresting millions of men, women and children. We did this to Japanese Americans in 1942, and we rightfully regret that abandonment of basic American decency. So the choice is clear: either we leave 11 million people in limbo and let them be joined by millions more, or we devise a path to earned legalization. You certainly can't enact a guest worker program without dealing with the millions already here, and the economic reality is that the demand for workers will be met with immigrants one way or another. Providing a path to earned legalization is not amnesty, albeit some will call it that. Let them: Fear mongers spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to call it amnesty -- and the American people saw through it. Polls show that large majorities of Americans favor providing illegal immigrants a path to legalization. Still, the path to legalization should recognize that laws have been broken. The presence of most of them benefits this country, but there must be accountability. Almost all illegal workers pay into the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. By legalizing them, they all will. And to be legalized, they should be required to pay any other back taxes they owe. They also should pay a fine for breaking the law. And they must learn English and have a clean record. If they meet all of these requirements, we should say, "Welcome to America. You're now a legal worker. Just remember, you're our guests and you must continue to follow these rules, and those that don't will face the consequences." And with instantaneous worker verification in place, we'll be able to do it. Finally, let me return to the subject of family. Our Constitution states unambiguously that if you are born in the United States you are a citizen of this country and you are guaranteed equal protection under all of our laws. It's estimated that more than 50% of all illegal immigrants have children who thus are citizens of the United States. If we required their parents to leave what would become of the minor children? Would they be made wards of the state somehow? They cannot be required to leave along with their parents. This is one of the reasons why I believe the legislation was passed in the House without any intent of it ever becoming law -- which is transparently dishonest leadership. And I believe the proponents of immigration reform have nothing to fear from those who have resorted to such tactics. The voters are fed up with that kind of politics and they are fed up with the failure to address pressing problems like illegal immigration. Most Democrats in the House of Representatives voted against the Republican bill to criminalize illegal immigration and Democrats are now in charge of the House. A bipartisan majority in the Senate passed the McCain-Kennedy bill. That majority grew larger on Election Day. And President Bush supports a guest worker program and a path to legalization. The new political lineup in Washington means that Congress has the numbers to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law next year which the President will sign. We have a historic opportunity to solve a problem that is tearing our country apart. We must not miss this chance. The Democratic Agenda for the next Congress is an excellent one -- raise the minimum wage, get lobbyists out of the business of writing legislation, allow Medicare to negotiate for the lowest possible prescription drug legislation, enact all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and change the course of our Iraq policy. Immigration reform must be added to the top of that list. The Democrats won the election and the price of leadership is doing what's right for America. Thank you very much. Thank you so much for having me here today. I'm not here to talk about another candidate's age, or their ambition. I'm here to talk about jobs for the American people. As I listen to the other candidates -- both Democrats and Republicans -- I wonder ... why aren't more of them talking about jobs? Among the people I have met on this campaign, I see fathers and mothers who have worked hard all their lives ... but don't know if they'll be able to provide for their sons and daughters. Everywhere I go, I see people working for America. But America doesn't seem to be working for them. I can sense the insecurity out there. And it's not just about keeping our homeland safe. It's about keeping safe our trust that the American government is on the side of the middle class. It's about keeping safe our belief that every American deserves a quality education ... and affirming that our country needs educated citizens if we are to stay strong. It's about keeping safe our faith that if we work hard, we can build a better tomorrow for our children and for our nation. The fact is that the President has not kept the faith. And the Congress has failed to lead. They're all locked in dysfunction and neither side wants to blink. So they keep sitting there, with their eyes wide open, watching the problems of America parade by. You know, every candidate in this race is asking for the biggest job promotion of their life. Now, if you've ever asked for a promotion – you know that the first question is going to be. "What have you done lately?" So let's look at what the Senate has done in the last twelve months since my colleagues took over the leadership of Congress. Did they get us out of Iraq? No. Did they scrap No Child Left Behind and reform education? No. Do million of poor children have the health insurance they need? No. Did they stop an Attorney General who wouldn't say that waterboarding is torture? No. Have they done enough to stop this country from slipping into recession? No. Are millions of Americans worried about keeping their jobs and their homes and their quality of life? Yes. I know that we can do better. And I have done better. In the last twelve months I helped shut down North Korea's nuclear reactor. We brought back the remains of 6 American soldiers from that country that had been missing since the Korean War, including Corporal Clem Boody from Independence, Iowa, whose funeral I attended last week. I extended health coverage to every child 12 and under in my state. I raised teacher salaries. I cracked down on unscrupulous lenders. I passed a landmark clean energy bill to create jobs and clean air. It's not just the last 12 months that I have been working hard for the people of America. When I took office as Governor, New Mexico's economy had stalled. Morale was low. We had no thriving industry, no plan for growth and a tax policy that discouraged investment and job creation. So I passed a tax credit for companies to create jobs that pay above the prevailing wage. We passed a permanent rural jobs tax credit. We enacted a three-year tax holiday for high-tech startups. We invested state money in local companies that showed great promise for success and job creation. Rather than use tax cuts to reward the wealthy ... I use them to reward putting people to work. I focused on growth industries like clean energy, wind and solar, aviation and high tech. We ended up creating over 80,000 jobs. We have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. And we're seventh in the nation for income growth. And I understand that education reform goes hand in hand with job creation. I invested heavily in New Mexico's schools ... billions of dollars into public education, including a statewide pre-K program. We shifted hundreds of millions of dollars from administration to classrooms. And we reduced the cost of a college education. Not only that ... we've given teachers a raise every year I've been in office. We were 46th in teacher pay ... now we're 29th and moving up. And when I'm President, teachers across this country will have a minimum average starting salary of $40,000 a year. Other candidates are talking about reforming No Child Left Behind. Well, I have a two word plan for this failed law: Scrap It. It's time to stop punishing struggling schools and start helping them again. I'm going to hire 100,000 new math science teachers. And we have to be innovative ... with ideas like math and science academies across the country, and programs like YouthBuild that reengage high school dropouts in their education. America has always been the world's greatest source of ingenuity and innovation. More than Cokes and Hershey bars, cars and computers, the world knows us as the preeminent supplier of progress and hope. And make no mistake: the world is looking to us for leadership. But it is clear that we cannot lead the people of the world forward, if we are letting our own people fall behind. Now is the time for bold action on jobs, but I'm not hearing anyone even talk about them. In the Democratic debate in Nevada, in the entire two hours, do you know how many times the word "jobs" was mentioned? Only five times. And the debate before that in Philadelphia? Three times. My friends, we are the Democratic Party. If we stand for anything, we stand for jobs. We stand for the rights of working Americans. And we stand for fairness and opportunity. And we can never forget that. It's why I'm proud to offer the most detailed jobs plan of any candidate for President. And I'm proud to be the only Democrat in this race with a record of creating jobs and turning an economy around. I know that we can do the same thing across the country. I know because in Iowa I see people who haven't given up on the American Dream. Despite the failures in Washington, I see people more committed than ever to giving their kids a better life than they've had. I know that we can do better because I am hopeful about America. In the past hundred years, we have overcome a Great Depression. We landed a man on the moon. We have beaten back fascism and Communism and totalitarianism around the globe. Restoring the strength of our economy is going to require fiscal responsibility. As a Governor, I have to balance my state's budget. I have balanced five budgets, and I have done it while cutting taxes and investing in our people and our infrastructure. Balancing the budget is investing in the future. It means that we are paying for what we get today, so our children don't have to. And that's why I support a Constitutional Amendment to balance the budget. And a line-item veto. We've allowed Republicans to spend recklessly for too long. Our children should have the right to be free from the extraordinary debts run up by their parents. The Government must honor the private sector and American entrepreneurship -- while working with investors and partnering with those taking risks to revitalize the economy. This is how it has always been. The Government started the internet, and the private sector improved and expanded it into one of the cornerstones of our economy. In a 21st Century economy, Government must act as a catalyst and a partner to help unleash the innovation and the job creation potential of the private sector. I will restore and increase funding for federal research and development programs. I will create a federal Angel Investor Tax Credit to encourage investment in high-tech startups. And I will make permanent and double the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. We must provide incentives for investment in cutting edge research and manufacturing. While we build for the future and repair the damage of the past, we must also invest in our people now. We need to move aggressively to create high-quality jobs and expand economic opportunity. The American Dream has always been big -- big enough for all of us. But for too many these days, the dream is shrinking and shutting them out. That is unacceptable. Every American deserves the opportunity to succeed. We need to get back to big dreams and bold ideas. In addition to creating new quality jobs, we need to preserve the ones we already have. We should restore America's focus on protecting our labor force. We must move beyond the debate over "Free Trade" versus "Protectionism." Instead we have to roll up our sleeves and pursue better trade agreements; agreements that enhance rather than erode U.S. jobs. Agreements that are socially just, environmentally responsible and politically sustainable. To protect our workers and keep America secure, I will do what the Congress and the President have not done ... pass comprehensive immigration reform. Washington has also failed to help families with the rising cost of living. Expenses for health care, child care, and a college education are rising faster than wages. Our next President must focus on making these more affordable. Our national strength is our people, and we must do whatever it takes to protect that resource. Look at the record. I brought unemployment to historic lows in New Mexico. None of my Democratic opponents has turned around an economy. And if you look at the Republican Governors on the other side, they haven't done it either. I'm looking forward to putting my record up against Mike Huckabee or Mitt Romney. We need to put a candidate up against the Republicans who knows how to create jobs. And more importantly, the next President better know how to. And I can tell you from experience: bickering doesn't create jobs. Speeches don't create jobs. Republicans don't create jobs. It's time for a President focused again on working Americans. I'm sick of the Republicans painting Democrats as fiscally irresponsible. We created the New Deal. They created the raw deal. We created the Great Society, they created the Great Depression. We created the boom of the 1990's. In the past seven years, the Republicans brought us the worst record of job creation since Herbert Hoover. It's time for a new vision. This vision is not a Republican dream. It's not a Democratic dream. It's not a black dream. It's not a brown dream. It's not a white dream. It's not a poor dream. It's not a rich dream. It's an American Dream. So my message for all those who are negative – those who are angry is this: Let's make it a reality. We can do it. To those who say our students can't do any better: I say they can. To those who say we can't create good-paying jobs here in America anymore -- I say we can. And we will. This is a time for bold leadership. And that's why I am going to win this thing. Because I have been tested. Because I've actually delivered many of the changes that others merely talk about. Or don't even talk about. I am going to win because I've got the most optimistic vision for this country's future. On education and jobs, I am offering bold leadership with results. I am going to win because we are going to do it together. Right? Right? We CAN do it together. I would be honored to have you caucus for me. Thank you very much. Thanks so much for having me here today. I have to say, I'm pretty impressed with myself -- a Presidential candidate who's only minutes late. But you know, there's really only one politician that the American people need to be on time. And that's in 9,597 hours when George Bush has to leave the White House. Forever. The next day we start repairing the damage and restoring the American dream. And the most important part of restoring that dream is ending the war in Iraq. In so many ways, it is the linchpin to everything we want to do as a country. It is the key to healing our divisions and bringing America together again. It is the basis for restoring American leadership around the world. It is the foundation upon which we can rebuild our faith in American leaders. And it is the necessary first step for creating good jobs, a quality education system, and a strong middle class. Some of my fellow candidates have decided to stop talking about Iraq. Their campaign strategies have shifted to other issues. Over the last few debates and on the campaign trail, our brave troops in Iraq seem to have been forgotten. I do believe that we need to talk about domestic issues. Too many Americans are worried about keeping their jobs and their homes. Too many Americans are worried that their children are not getting the quality education that they need to compete in the world. But the fact is...we cannot move forward on any of these issues while our troops are left behind in Iraq. Some have said that we can change America at home, while we keep troops in Iraq for perhaps five years or longer. That's not an equation that adds up. It doesn't add up financially. It doesn't add up morally. It doesn't add up for America. And let me say that the national media deserves its fair share of blame for forgetting our troops as well. Perhaps they think the casualties are old news. Perhaps they think that covering silly food fights between candidates will get them better ratings. Perhaps they think that because fewer of our troops have died lately... that Americans don't care anymore. Well, we do. And I dare the media to tell the families of the 37 troops who were killed last month that this issue doesn't deserve front-page coverage. I think about a young man from La Mesa, New Mexico named James Pirtle, an Army Specialist who served in Iraq. On October 3rd, 2003, he was killed in action, He was the first New Mexican killed there. And I think about his mother, who sent me a letter afterwards asking me to make sure that her son's sacrifice for this country never be forgotten. Well, we will not forget. The most important issue in this race to decide who will go up against Republicans next fall is not some abstract notion of the word change. It's not about who said what in kindergarten. It's not about past drug use. It's about our brave troops being killed in the middle of a civil war. And it's about who's going to put an end to it. My disagreements with my opponents in this race are not personal. I refuse to engage in negative character attacks. But there is a profound difference on the war in Iraq. In a recent debate, Senator Clinton, Senator Obama, and Senator Edwards were asked to pledge to have all our troops out by 2013. 2013. They would not do so. I have made that pledge. In fact, I will get them all out in under a year. 2013 is over five years from now. If we still have troops in Iraq in 2013, the Iraqis sure won't think the war is over. And neither will the American people. Five more years of our brave troops being killed and wounded. I won't allow it. Our troops have done a magnificent job. They DESERVE to come home. Senator Clinton, Senator Obama, and Senator Edwards are saying it may take them longer to end the war in Iraq than it took FDR to win World War II. That's not leadership. We have to be bolder for the sake of our people in harm's way. We can get out faster. I'm tired of the naysayers who say we can't do it. The experts know it. I've read the briefings. I've talked to my military advisors. I know we can do it...and the American people know it too. And we don't just wave goodbye. I'll call a reconciliation conference to implement accords to end the war. I'll establish an international donor conference and build a UN-sanctioned predominantly Muslim peacekeeping force. That's how we fix Iraq. But we can't do it until all of our troops are on their way out. The deaths of our troops will not bring the parties together. But diplomacy will. I know it will because I've worked in the region. As UN Ambassador, I spent eighty percent of my time on Iraq and the Middle East. As a special envoy, I negotiated with Saddam Hussein himself. The bottom line is this: our presence in Iraq is blocking reconciliation by the parties and fueling hatred of the United States around the world. We are less safe staying in Iraq than we are leaving. We need to get our troops out in order to focus on our real security needs, and upon our needs at home. If we get our troops out and give diplomacy a chance, then we can give education a chance. We can give health care a chance. And we can give our economy a chance. Right now, we can't move forward on these issues, because Iraq is poisoning the relationship between Congress and the President. Domestic investments are being held hostage by Republicans who are demanding unfettered war spending. And they are being backed up by a stubborn President with nothing to lose. They are refusing to move on any of our country's urgent domestic needs, until they get billions of dollars in war money. Just look at the last twelve months. We still have nine million children with no health insurance. We still have the failed policy called No Child Left Behind. We still have no comprehensive immigration reform. We still have Guantanamo and torture and eavesdropping. We still have too many families worried about losing their homes to foreclosure. The economy may be slipping into a recession. Millions of Americans are worried about their quality of life. Millions of Americans no longer have faith in their government. They elected this Congress to the end the war. They have not done so. And they see a President more concerned about his legacy and his pride than about ending a war that continues to take too many lives and too many billions of dollars. We all know the terrible human cost of this war. Some of America's children, who will know their fathers and mothers only through pictures and newspaper stories... know those costs all too well. But it is also clear that there has been a grievous financial cost to our country. We've spent $500 billion dollars on this war already. The war's true cost could be closer to 2 trillion dollars1 when you look at disability care for our wounded vets. And make no mistake, those returning from Iraq absolutely must get the best care. Closer to two trillion dollars when you consider that instability in the Middle East caused by the war has driven oil prices close to a hundred dollars a barrel. And that's not an abstract number for families here in Iowa trying to keep their homes warm this winter. Closer to two trillion dollars when you consider the economic productivity that has vanished because of the lives lost to this war. Think of what we could have done with two trillion dollars: We could have had universal health care. We could have fully funded Social Security for generations. We could have raised the salary of every teacher in America. We could have been well on our way to energy independence. Just two weeks of the Iraq war costs us more than we spend on cancer research in a whole year. Now think of what we will fail to do...if we stay in Iraq for another five years, as some of my Democratic colleagues are willing to do. Or even decades as some Republicans have said we must do. It's time for a new vision. This vision is not a Republican dream. It's not a Democratic dream. It's not a black dream. It's not a brown dream. It's not a white dream. It's not a poor dream. It's not a rich dream. It's an American Dream, in which all of our troops are coming home. In which our government works for the middle class. To those who say our students can't do any better: I say they can. I have a sixty-billion dollar plan to improve education from pre-K to college and beyond. On No Child Left Behind -- I don't think "reforming" or "tweaking" it is enough. I think we need to be bolder. I would scrap it. We need to raise teacher salaries and focus on science and math. In fact, I would set a new national goal: That American students be number one in science and math within 15 years. Part of that is putting arts back into the schools. Art and music help kids with math and science. I know we can do it because in my state, we raised teacher salaries, established a statewide pre-K program, and made college more affordable. To those who say we can't beat the lobbies and pass health care reform: I know we can -- because I did it. All kids twelve and under in my state today have access to health insurance, and we are going cover everyone else by 2010. When I am President, every family will have access to the same health insurance that Congress and the President have, And our veterans will have a Heroes Health Card so that they can the care they deserve wherever they need it. We're going to require full, mandatory funding of the VA health care system. And we're going to start treating mental trauma such as PTSD the same way we treat physical wounds -- like the battlefield injuries that they are. And we are going to do right by the families of the men and women serving in our nation's armed forces. Our military families make enormous sacrifices everyday on behalf of the nation. It is not uncommon that spouses and parents are forced to leave their jobs to care for their returning wounded. As President, I will offer up to one year of paid disability insurance for the family member who leaves a job to care for an injured veteran. To those who say we can't create high-quality jobs here in America anymore -- I say we can. When I took office as Governor, New Mexico's economy had stalled. Morale was low. We had no thriving industry, no plan for growth and a tax policy that discouraged investment and job creation. So I passed a tax credit for companies to create jobs that pay above the prevailing wage. We passed a permanent rural jobs tax credit. We enacted a three-year tax holiday for high-tech startups. Rather than use tax cuts to reward the wealthy ... I used them to reward putting people to work. I focused on growth industries like clean energy, wind and solar, aviation and high tech. We ended up creating over 80,000 jobs. We have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. And we're seventh in the nation for income growth. My friends, we are the Democratic Party. We stand for jobs. We stand for the rights of working Americans. And we stand for fairness and opportunity. And we can never forget that. It's why I'm proud to offer the most detailed jobs plan of any candidate for President. And I'm proud to be the only Democrat in this race with a record of creating jobs and turning an economy around. I know that we can do the same thing across the country. I know...because in Iowa I see people who haven't given up on the American Dream. Despite the failures in Washington, I see people more committed than ever to giving their kids a better life than they've had. Restoring the strength of our economy is going to require fiscal responsibility. The single most fiscally irresponsible act in American history has been George Bush's unfunded war in Iraq. Balancing the budget is investing in the future. It means that we are paying for what we get today, so our children don't have to. And that's why I support a Constitutional Amendment to balance the budget. And a line-item veto. We've allowed the Republicans to spend recklessly for too long. I know how to balance a budget -- I've done it five times as Governor. I also know that in a 21st Century economy, Government must act as a partner to help unleash the innovation and the job creation potential of the private sector. I will restore and increase funding for federal research and development programs. I will create a federal Angel Investor Tax Credit to encourage investment in high-tech startups. And I will make permanent and double the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. We must provide incentives for investment in cutting-edge research and manufacturing. While we build for the future and repair the damage of the past, we must also invest in our people now. We need to move aggressively to create high-quality jobs and expand economic opportunity. The American Dream has always been big -- big enough for all of us. But for too many these days, the dream is shrinking and shutting them out. That is unacceptable. Every American deserves the opportunity to succeed. We need to get back to big dreams and bold ideas. In addition to creating new high-quality jobs, we need to preserve the ones we already have. We should restore America's focus on protecting our labor force. I have stood with working men and women who belong to labor unions my entire career. They play a vital role in advancing the rights of American workers. A union job means a good-paying job...with good benefits. I believe employees and workers have a fundamental right to organize and bargain collectively, which is why the second bill I signed as Governor restored collective bargaining rights to New Mexico Public employees. We negotiated the first project labor agreement in my state's history, and we made our prevailing wage a union wage. And when I am President, my Secretary of Labor will be a union member, and I will fire all the union-busting lawyers at the NLRB. And I will push for and sign the Employee Free Choice Act. We must move beyond the tired debate over "Free Trade" versus "Protectionism." Instead we have to roll up our sleeves and pursue better trade agreements; agreements that enhance rather than erode U.S. jobs. Washington has failed to help families with the rising cost of living. Expenses for health care, child care, and a college education are rising faster than wages. Our next President must focus on making these more affordable. And the war in Iraq has helped push oil prices through the roof. The price of keeping a home warm is a terrible pressure on American families. Our national strength is our people, and we must do whatever it takes to protect that resource. Now is a time for bold leadership. Washington should not be bickering while our troops are dying in the field. The next President is going to have to bring this country together. Think of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. They do not serve as Democrats or as Republicans -- they serve as Americans. We must do the same here at home. But this war has divided us. And it will continue to do so until every American troop is out of Iraq. The human and economic toll this war is taking on our nation must end. The day after I take the oath of office, and pledge to protect the Constitution of this country...I am going to tell our troops in Iraq: you have served magnificently. Now you are coming home. The next day, I will tell the Congress that we are going to honor their service, by rolling up our sleeves, and doing the work that has been so long neglected. Providing quality health care to all our citizens. Making American classrooms the best in the world. And creating the next generation of high-quality American jobs. We can do it together. Right? Right? We CAN do it together. I would be honored to have you caucus for me. Thank you very much. Yesterday we were all reminded that we live in a dangerous and violent world. The assassination of Benazir Bhutto is a tragedy. For her family. For her country. And for people all over the world who love peace and freedom. Benazir Bhutto devoted her life to bringing democracy to the people of Pakistan. People who have known far too much of tyranny and violence and far too little of liberty. She could have chosen to live a life of comfort in exile. But instead, she risked her life for the things that she believed in. The principles of democracy. The dignity of human beings. These were her ideals. These are our ideals. I've represented America around the world. In refugee camps. In prisons run by dictators. In the midst of civil wars. And I have learned that people are often sustained and moved by little more than an unshakeable belief in these ideals. Benazir Bhutto's assassins were taking aim at democracy. They have taken sides against the global struggle for human rights. America itself is challenged by this horrible tragedy. A question is put before us. It is a question that is asked us every day, with greater and greater urgency. That question is: what will our nation stand for? Even as we mourn the death of one voice for freedom ... we must answer clearly and forcefully the question of America's role in a dangerous world. We must answer. For though America under Bush has lost its way as the leader of the world - billions of people still yearn for our basic principles: Freedom. Equality. Human dignity. These are the values that America must stand for. These are the values that I will fight for as President. Some say standing for such principles ... weakens us. They say that we cannot fight evil without sacrificing our core beliefs. They are wrong. If we have learned anything over the last 7 years -- it is that when America fails to live up to its own ideals, we are weaker, not stronger, as a result. When we live our democratic principles, as we have in the past, we are stronger. We are stronger at home. We are stronger abroad. And our strength makes us safer. But history has taught us that we are only as strong as our leaders are willing to be when faced with the politics of expediency, when they choose power over principle, tyranny over freedom. I pledge to you today, with all my being and with all my resolve I will never compromise our nation or show weakness in the face of tyranny. America must always lead in the name of freedom and we should never allow our nation to perpetuate dictatorships or provide support to tyrants to oppress their people. These policies not only betray our values, they make us weaker and less safe ... turning whole populations against us. We are at our strongest when we stand for principle over power. Yesterday, I called for President Musharraf to step down. Today, as a nation I am calling on the administration to stand firm for our ideals in the face of terrorism and in respect for the ideals Bhutto stood for. Anything less would send a dangerous signal to the world that terrorism alters our resolve. We must learn that when our policies and our actions conflict with the democratic goals of a nation, of their own people, we fail. The world looks to America for leadership. But the Bush Administration has failed to build a foreign policy worthy of our ideals. Instead, Mr. Bush has given us Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, secret prisons, wiretapping, and torture. Our moral leadership around the world has been tarnished. And make no mistake: This administration is losing the war on terrorism. Yesterday's assassination tells us this. The resurgence of Al Qaeda and the Taliban -- especially along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border -- tell us this. Our continuing presence in Iraq tells us this. Bush's foreign policy has failed ... but not for lack of opportunity to make it better. When Musharraf declared martial law, we could have stood up. But we did not. When he suspended the Constitution, we could have stood up. But we did not. Now after yesterday's terrible murder ... the United States must stand up. President Bush should immediately suspend non-terrorism related military aid to Pakistan until President Musharraf resigns. Not one penny more ... until Musharraf is gone and the rule of law is restored. Months ago, when the constitutional crisis erupted ... I said that we must stand with the Pakistani people. That we must use our military aid as leverage to force elections. Instead, Bush chose to continue to support the dictator ... and the terror went on unabated. Pakistan is a state with nuclear weapons, and our current policies are pushing it in the wrong direction. We have subsidized oppression for too long ... and the costs have not only been paid in dollars. We have paid with our security. We have paid with the safety of American lives. Some of my Democratic opponents have misplaced faith in Musharraf. Like the Bush Administration, they cling to a misguided notion that Musharraf can be trusted as an ally to fight terrorism or to change his despotic ways. Despite their faith, Musharraf has thumbed his nose at America again and again. How many times does the Washington conventional wisdom need to be proven tragically wrong ... before Washington insiders give up on it? Musharraf must step aside now ... and allow a technocratic caretaker government to lead the country until free and fair elections are held. And those elections should be held very soon. Some say there are risks to Musharraf stepping down. But the risks are greater if he does not. His inadequate attempts to disrupt terrorist activities on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan ... have only encouraged tribal leaders to cooperate with the Taliban. Indeed, the border area has been turned into a safe haven for terrorists. And though some stoke the fears of an Islamist takeover of Pakistan ... the reality is that the vast majority of Pakistanis will vote for the mainstream democratic parties -- as they always have in the past. Currently, polls show that only fifteen percent of Pakistanis would vote for the Islamist parties. But if we continue to support tyranny in Pakistan ... that number will only grow -- a lesson brought home to us all too painfully by yesterday's violence. Musharraf's narrow political base plays into the hands of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Only a broadly-based, democratically-elected government will be able to wage what Musharraf promised, but did not deliver -- an effective war against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. President Bush faced a choice with Pakistan -- he needed to choose whether to support the dictator or the Pakistani people. He chose the dictator. Repeatedly. And by doing so, he has let down both the American and the Pakistani people. We cannot afford another President who is a foreign policy novice. We cannot afford another President who takes the easiest path ... rather than the right path. A President who makes wrong choices, because he doesn't know how to make the hard but right choices. The next President must be a leader who has been tested. In the course of this campaign, all the candidates were asked whether there were times when we should put human rights before our security. That question is a symptom of the thinking that is leading us astray. It is a false choice. Our principles are the backbone of our security. They give us direction. They bring us allies. They make us strong. Some of us have always known that. Nearly ten years ago, Al Qaeda first attacked America in East Africa. Months before that attack, I went to Afghanistan to press the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden. They refused. So we imposed tough UN sanctions on them, and began building a coalition to keep America safe. After my trip to Afghanistan, bin Laden put out a threat on my life, but I knew that we were doing the right thing. Unfortunately, President Bush reversed course. Until 9-11, he ignored the many experts who warned him that Al Qaeda was planning to attack us at home. And then, after the Afghanistan campaign, he took his eye off the ball again. He squandered our resources and international support by conducting a disastrous war of choice in Iraq. Because of his inexperience, he listened to the ideologues. That war has diverted critical intelligence and military resources from the fight against Al Qaeda and terrorism. We let up the pressure and Al Qaeda recovered. So the result today is an Al Qaeda which is more diffuse and more deadly than ever. Our intelligence services say it is headquartered in Pakistan, along the Afghanistan border, and that it is planning and training to attack America at home again. We need to address the threat of international terrorism with the focus it deserves. The war against Al Qaeda is a tough military fight, but that it is more than just a military fight. It is also a fight for the hearts and minds of the world's Muslims. And Bush's botched occupation of Iraq has played right into the hands of the Jihadists -- bolstering their propaganda that the US wants to kill Muslims, and that we invaded Iraq so that we could control the Muslim world's oil. Never has America been as unpopular as it is today. In Iraq, and in many other Muslim countries, polls show that our credibility has plummeted. As a direct result of the President's poor choices, large majorities of Muslims now say they distrust America. Such sentiment facilitates Jihadist recruitment and boosts their popular support. And to hear the Republican candidates for President ... they would continue this nation on a truly dangerous path. They fail to recognize that the enduring power rests not just in our military strength -- but in our ideals. We must win the war of ideas with Al Qaeda. The people of the world will embrace us if we return to an American foreign policy based not only upon our power, but also upon our values. I will close Guantanamo and all secret prisons. We will again honor the Geneva conventions and we will require other nations to honor the treaty in protecting our soldiers. When I am President, I will put an end to torture. And there will be investigations. We will find out who was responsible for the torture that America has engaged in, and they will be prosecuted. No one will be above the law. NO ONE. We will lead the world once again as a champion of democracy and human rights. We will care about places like Darfur. We will lead the people of the world to stop the genocide there. We will not turn a blind eye to human suffering. We will again lead the fight against disease and poverty across the planet.America is better than the Bush-Cheney administration. To win the war against Al Qaeda ... we must return to our proud traditions. To defeat Al Qaeda, we must get our troops out of Iraq and reinforce our presence along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. We must enhance our commitment -- military, political and economic -- to Afghanistan. To finally defeating the murderers who attacked this country on 9-11. Defeating the resurgent Taliban will require a significant increase in NATO forces along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. And that will require restored American credibility and skillful American leadership. Americans deserve to know today ... what the candidates' plans are -- not the day one of us is inaugurated. I have been clear. I believe our obsession with Iraq undermines our ability to fight the real terrorists. We must get all our troops out of Iraq and as quickly and responsibly as possible. Only then, will we have the resources and credibility to destroy the organization that attacked us on 9/11. I have also been more specific than my colleagues about Afghanistan. I am calling for five additional brigades to be deployed to Afghanistan. That's 20,000 troops. Two brigades should be sent to the border to stop terrorists from infiltrating Afghanistan through the Pakistani border. I would send two brigades to the south to fight a resurgent Taliban there. And one brigade should redeploy to the west to deter Iran from any thoughts of expansionism. We also need a civilian surge in war against terrorism. The military cannot and should not shoulder the entire burden of our foreign policy -- the whole government must pitch in. That means activating engineers, diplomats, and other essential professionals to contribute to the broader effort. We cannot win the war against Al Qaeda alone. It is urgent that we rebuild our alliances, so that we can once again lead other nations. Trust is critical to getting allies to work with us in the secret world of counter terrorism and in the open world of public diplomacy. This administration has driven away our allies with swagger and saber rattling. I will rebuild our alliances by making common cause with partners who share our values and interests. The people of the world are thirsty for America to once again stand for the great ideals of human history. Americans want our global leadership to be worthy of the principles, values, and traditions we have inherited. Our people do not lack the courage to stand for a foreign policy that is both strong and decent. What the American people ARE missing ... what our country DOES desperately need ... is a leader who has been tested. A President who has been there, and who knows what the real choices are and how to make them. A President who has the experience to lead in dangerous times. We need a President who recognizes that this is not the time for consultants and political calculation. A President cannot decide what is right by taking a poll. We need someone who is true to America's optimistic spirit. Anger, bickering, mistrust ... should not define our nation. We need to stand united once again: clear about who we are and what we need to do to meet the serious challenges we face. And so today, in the wake of tragedy, I see hope. I see a new way forward for American leadership in the world. And I offer not perfection, not some set of consultant-driven sound bites. I offer authentic leadership. I have been tested. I have represented America all over the world. I have delivered for my country -- from bringing hostages home to negotiating ceasefires to protecting us from nuclear terrorism. The American people should not settle for untested leadership. And I will not settle for global leadership unworthy of the American people. In negotiating with the worst the world has to offer, I have come to understand what is best in humanity. And today, I ask you to join my fight for what's best about America, and what's best about our world. I ask you to stand for me at the caucuses. I ask you to stand for a new foreign policy and for someone with the experience to make it happen. Thank you. Just a few days from now, Iowans like you will make a very important choice. You will not just be standing up for a nominee. You will be standing up for what you believe America's role in the world should be. Just two days ago we were given a stark and terrible reminder of why real foreign policy experience matters when choosing a President. When terrorists killed Benazir Bhutto on Thursday, they sent a message to the world -- that those who treasure and fight for democracy do so at great risk. It also reminds us that the world looks to America and depends on our leadership and our powerful positive influence. We must move swiftly and strongly in support of democracy and insist on elections and a coordinated effort to track and defeat terrorists in Pakistan and wherever they operate. Over the last eleven months, I've been able to share with Iowans what I've been fighting for my entire life: an American foreign policy based on American principles. Equality. Freedom. Human dignity. These are the values that every American has inherited. And today, I want to tell you how we can be worthy of them. Americans are a generous people, and a courageous people. We rescued Europe from fascism, and generations from despair. Our farms have been the breadbasket to the world ... and our scientists have saved millions of lives through discoveries like antibiotics and the polio vaccine. And we are the nation that lit the fire of human freedom. The world looks to America for leadership. But the Bush Administration has failed to live up to our unmatched record of human achievement. Many of the fights that America used to lead are now being lost. The first task we will have to handle in rebuilding our global leadership and our foreign policy ... is to end the war in Iraq. George Bush's failed policies have sapped our moral leadership around the world. He has sullied America's good name. He's broken the backbone of our strength. But all the blame doesn't belong at the feet of the President. Washington itself is broken. Congress, which was elected to end this war ... has not done so. They have not merely failed our party ... they have failed our country. And they have failed the brave men and women in Iraq ... who deserve to come home. Americans -- whether they reside in red, blue, or purple states -- have lost faith in this government. Too many lies were told about Iraq. There were too many flawed plans and too much ineptitude in their execution. Bush and Cheney failed to understand that American leadership in the world requires the faith and the backing of the American people here at home. The Commander-in-Chief is our voice in world, and must represent our entire nation ... not a narrow set of ideologues from one political party. And the Congress has abetted this failure. It's a failure that cannot stand. There is a choice. The differences I have with my opponents in this race are not personal. I refuse to engage in negative character attacks. But there is a profound difference on the war in Iraq. In a recent debate, Senators Clinton, Obama, and Edwards were asked to pledge to have all our troops out by 2013. 2013. They would not do so. I have made that pledge. In fact, I will get them all out in a year. 2013 is over five years from now. If we still have troops in Iraq in 2013, the Iraqis won't think the war is over. And neither will the American people. Five more years of our brave troops being killed and wounded. I won't allow it. Our troops have done a magnificent job. The bottom line is this: my opponents believe in changing the mission. They wish to task our troops with new combat roles, new training roles, and new policing roles. I see it differently. Changing the mission is not ending the war. One year from now, I don't want to have to wake up and lower my state's flags for another New Mexican killed in Iraq. Three years from now, I don't want to read in the morning newspaper about bombing attacks against Americans ... because our presence in Iraq continues to inflame the Muslim world. Five years from now, I don't want to see kids who are eighth-graders today, patrolling and dying on the streets of Baghdad. To everything, there is a season. A time to keep silent ... and a time to speak. A time for war ... and a time for peace. Now is the time for peace. Now is the time to stand up and be counted. Our presence in Iraq is blocking reconciliation by the parties and fueling hatred of the United States around the world. We must face this fundamental reality: we are less safe staying in Iraq than we are leaving. The US Military just conducted focus groups all over Iraq ... with Iraqi citizens of all stripes. And the Iraqis -- Kurds, Shia, and Sunnis -- agreed on two major things: the American military invasion is the principal reason for division in that country. And that in order for reconciliation and peace to take place ... American troops must leave. Have we not learned that no matter how noble or how well-meaning ... our troops cannot secure a nation where they are not wanted. That is one of the lessons of this war that many have not learned. As we move forward to restore American leadership ... we must learn from our mistakes in Iraq. I fear that some of my opponents have not learned these lessons. Those who foresee us staying in Iraq -- with even a small force -- for years to come have failed to learn that our very presence occupying a Muslim nation is undermining nearly every goal of our foreign policy. Keeping troops in Iraq blocks our ability to build global coalitions to fight poverty, AIDS and disease. It undercuts our ability to lead this planet to a solution to the climate crisis. And let me be clear: Leaving forces in Iraq severely hinders our ability to build coalitions to fight terrorism. These are not the only lessons we must learn. In confronting international problems, diplomacy must be our first resort ... and war must be our last. And while international cooperation will not always succeed ... cowboy diplomacy will almost always fail. Our foreign policy decisions must be based in reality, not ideology. We must never again allow politics to trump the hard work of our intelligence agencies. Nor should foreign policy decisions be dictated by a Washington conventional wisdom that was wrong before, during, and after our invasion of Iraq. Those who subscribe to the new Washington wisdom that we must leave our troops in Iraq indefinitely ... are getting it wrong again. Only in Washington, would people suggest that leaving a smaller force behind could accomplish what a much larger force has not yet done. We have been down the road of an undermanned force before. And we paid the costs dearly. For the sake of our troops, we cannot make that mistake again. A smaller force is the worst of both worlds. Not strong enough to stabilize Iraq. But large enough to block political reconciliation and remain a target in the middle of a civil war. Before I discuss a new vision for a post-Iraq foreign policy, let me talk about the fears that we all have. I know that many of you want to get the troops out ... but are worried about what will happen once we leave. Americans across Iowa and across the country share your concern. I share your concern. So, let me address this directly. First and foremost: the safety of our brave men and women in the field is our most important duty. We owe them more than we owe anyone. Our troops have done a magnificent job. They have done all that has been asked of them, and more. It is long past time for the Iraqi factions themselves to take responsibility for bringing peace to their own country. The Iraqi government has failed on almost every relevant measure ... to take advantage of the security we have provided. Only when we leave will they lift themselves off the crutch of American military force. To those who say they will not do so, I say they must do so. Does anyone honestly believe that it is America's job to fight the Iraqi civil war? Because I believe it is up to the Iraqis to put an end to their civil war. And we won't just wave goodbye. What Iraq needs now is not more troops, more guns, more fighting. What Iraq needs now is more money for its economy, for roads, for schools. Iraq will not be rebuilt at the point of a gun. We need an international donors' conference to share the burden of stabilizing Iraq. Security cannot be provided by American forces that have become targets. We are both ally and enemy of Iraqi factions. We have long known that two-thirds of Iraqis think it's ok shoot American troops. Indeed, there are 3,000 attacks on our brave men and women every month. As I said before, according to new military intelligence ... most Iraqis, no matter what ethnic or sectarian group they're from, believe that the key to their national reconciliation is the departure of American troops. They consider us foreign occupiers. We cannot rescue a country that does not want to be rescued. And if we persist in trying to do so, it will undermine our ability to turn the corner and once again be the conscience and the leader of the world. What we can do is build a multinational peacekeeping force which will provide security in Iraq. I know the region -- I have negotiated with many of the leaders there. I faced down Saddam Hussein. And after careful consideration, it is clear to me that a partition will not work. The United States must show resolve -- we need to be a tough but honest broker that brings the parties together -- but we do not want Iraq to disintegrate. The U.S. must lead the parties to a solution -- not impose one on them. The Iraqis don't want it. Historically, foreign-imposed solutions like a partition have ended in bloody failure. And by leaving our troops in Iraq, the fundamental problem will still be there. We need to work with nations in the region -- we have common interests in avoiding a failed Iraq. Iraq's neighbors do not want instability on their borders. They do not want streams of Iraqi refugees destabilizing their own countries. But they will not work with us untilwe get our troops out of Iraq. Only when we have put this disaster behind us, we can begin to restore our reputation and rebuild our capacity for global leadership. Just look at what's happened in Basra, where the British pulled out all their forces. That area has seen a ninety percent reduction in violence. That is what we need to achieve across Iraq. We need a "New Realism" in our foreign policy. A policy that sees the world as it really is, but is dedicated to making it a better place. In this complex, interdependent world, this means rejecting the simple-minded unilateralism of the Bush administration -- because it does not work. It means embracing American global leadership -- because it does. In the 21st century, America can defend its national interest only by leading other nations to embrace thoughtful and global solutions. We need to blend our interests with theirs, as we seek common solutions to common problems. We can meet urgent challenges. International terrorism. Nuclear proliferation. Climate change. Environmental degradation. Economic and political instability. These are not just the problems of individual nations. They are the problems of an interdependent world. Consider that more than a billion people survive on less than a dollar a day, and that nearly half of the world's 2 billion children live in poverty. In my travels abroad, I have seen human desperation -- first hand. In the Sudan, I have been to camps filled with families who have lost every worldly possession. I was on the ground in Turkey during a terrible earthquake, where I saw impoverished mothers on their knees, digging through rubble for their lost children. We urgently need to find the courage and the will to once again lead the fight against global problems. Not only because we are a decent and compassionate people, but also because of this inescapable reality: America will never be safe in a world riddled by poverty, desperation, hatred and violence. A hungry world will also hunger for scapegoats. A thirsty world will thirst for revenge. A world in crisis will be a world of anger and violence and terrorism. And unless and until we have the wisdom and the skill to secure all the nuclear weapons and fissile material in the world ... that terrorism could result in unthinkable death and destruction. I have travelled the world again and again, on many international delegations and personal missions. And it has been me -- the American -- from which the most has been asked. And so it should be. The world expects much from America. And we must expect even more from ourselves. Consider the menace of global warming. The ice caps and glaciers are melting. Sea levels are rising. 300 million human beings live less than fifteen feet above sea level. Unless we act now, homes, villages, cities, and entire nations will be submerged. In America ... in a nation that has long fed the world...catastrophically rising temperatures threaten to decimate our farmland. Here in Iowa, the foundation for an entire way of life could melt away. We must lead the world in the development of clean, alternative energy. We must work with other governments and private business to make sure that new technologies are adopted worldwide. Along the way to making New Mexico the Clean Energy State, I learned some lessons. The most important is that Americans are ready to act. All they need is a President who is ready to lead. Once you lead, you find allies in corners that you never knew existed. Businesses. Non-profits. Activists. Former enemies and future friends. We can build the first true global coalition since America united the world to defeat communism. We must also strengthen and expand the international coalition fighting the rising threat of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. It is a war we are in danger of losing, and one we cannot afford to lose. Our own National Intelligence Estimate tells us that Al Qaeda and the Taliban are resurgent. This has been the deadliest year for American forces in Afghanistan. Almost half the country is now too dangerous for aid workers to operate in. We must redeploy five brigades -- twenty thousand troops -- to Afghanistan to hunt down terrorists and fight the Taliban. But we can only do it if we end the war in Iraq, which has stretched our forces to the limit. To those who want to keep our troops in the middle of Iraq's civil war ... I say: it's finally time that we commit the forces to defeating those who actually attacked us on 9/11. As we gather our strength to meet our many global challenges ... we must remember that preserving popularity is no recipe for inspiring a nation, let alone the world. Now is not the time for polls or consultants or political calculation. Now is not the time for more division or on-the-job training. Now is the time for leadership that has been tes ted. My colleagues in this race have my respect, but it's a simple fact that the next international deal negotiated by any one of the frontrunners ... will be their first. We cannot afford another President who thinks that stubbornness is strength. Consultation with friends, coordination with allies -- and negotiation with enemies -- is not weakness. It is what you need to do to get things done. I ask all Americans to join me in making our nation once again ... the world's beacon of hope. Together we need: The compassion to commit the necessary resources. The courage to stand fast in the face of inevitable setbacks. The determination to put our troops first. And the resolve to shunt aside the naysayers and the Washington conventional wisdom ... and simply do what we know is right. If George Bush had listened to me when I entered this race, all of our troops would now be out of Iraq. And most of them would have spent this Christmas with their families. Let's make absolutely sure that next Christmas ... all of them do. If you caucus for me ... together ... we can make it happen. Thank you. Thank you very much, Barbara, and Tom Udall. Thank you for all coming here today. I want to begin today by speaking directly to those who've supported my campaign for president from the very beginning, those that joined us along the way, those who were with us at the end, and most importantly, the people of New Mexico. It is with great pride, understanding and acceptance that I am ending my campaign for president of the United States. It was my hope that you would first hear it from me directly and not from a news organization. But, unfortunately, as with too many things in our world today, it's the ending of something that garners the most intense interest and speculation. You know, it's been an exhilarating and humbling year, an experience I will treasure and I will never forget. The voters of this country, and particularly of the early primary states, where I focused my campaign, tested me in ways that I've never been tested. We had 200 debates. Actually, it was only 24, but it felt like 200. (LAUGHTER) And there I believe that we made our case to the people. We made our case for change, but guided by an experienced hand. We made our case for a foreign policy with principles and realism. (APPLAUSE) Of rebuilding alliances through diplomacy and unflagging support for democracy. We made our case for rebuilding our country with a laser-like focus on economic growth, quality jobs, like we've done here in New Mexico, investing in education, science, math and the arts, and providing universal health care. RICHARDSON: And we made our case for bringing people together, as I've done for my entire life -- Democrats, independents, Republicans, citizens, community groups -- to break the gridlock in Washington and get things done for the American people. I knew from the beginning that this would be an upward climb. When I entered the campaign, it was clear that we as Democrats had the most talented field of my entire lifetime running to change the direction of our country. And in the end, one of them will. And despite overwhelming financial and political odds, I am proud of the campaign we waged... (APPLAUSE) ... and the influence, and, most importantly the influence we had on the issues that matter the most to the future of this country. A year ago, we were the only campaign calling for the removal of all our troops within a year's time from Iraq. We were the only campaign calling for a complete reform of education, including the scrapping of No Child Left Behind. And we were the campaign that was the most aggressive in clean energy and the most ambitious standards reducing global warming. Now, all the remaining candidates have come to our point of view. (APPLAUSE) And I am confident -- and I am confident that the next president of the United States will implement much of what we've been urging for the last 12 months, and our nation -- and our world -- will be better for it. RICHARDSON: You know, this has been a remarkable process. I've learned that I don't have all the answers and that not every solution... (LAUGHTER) ... can be found inside the Beltway. I've been grilled in over a thousand forums and town meetings, pressed on my views, my accomplishments, my ideas and policy prescriptions for this great country. From the farm towns of Iowa to the mountain towns of New Hampshire, from the South Carolina shore to the glittering cities of Nevada, I travel hundreds and thousands of miles, face tens of thousands of citizens. They shared their hopes, their dreams, their problems and questions with me. And boy, there were some very tough questions. I gave them the best I had. And I gave this race the best I had. (APPLAUSE) And... (APPLAUSE) Thank you. I'm noticing who's not standing up. (LAUGHTER) We raised over $22 million, 68,000 donors; we built a multi-state organization of hundreds of thousands of staff and volunteers; we had organized steering committees in 36 states; we're on the ballot in 42 states; and we worked harder than anyone. Boy, did we work harder than anyone. And we did our best. (APPLAUSE) And that is all we can do. And that's all we can expect from each other. You know, running for president brings out the best in everyone who graces the stage. And I've learned a lot from the other candidates running. RICHARDSON: They have all brought great talents and abilities to the campaign. Senator Biden, his passion and intellect are remarkable. Senator Dodd is the epitome of selfless dedication to public service in the Democratic Party. Senator Edwards is a singular voice for the most downtrodden and forgotten among us. Senator Obama is a bright light of hope and optimism at a time of great national unease, yet he is also grounded in thoughtful wisdom beyond his years. Senator Clinton's poise in the face of adversity is matched only by her lifetime of achievement and deep understanding of the challenges we face. Representative Kucinich is a man of great decency and dedication who will faithfully soldier on, no matter how great the odds. And all of us in the Democratic Party owe Senator Mike Gravel our appreciation for his brave leadership during the national turmoil of Vietnam. I am honored to have shared the stage with each of those Democrats. And I'm enormously grateful to all of my supporters who, despite so many other good candidates, went our way. Now that my time in this national campaign has come to an end, I would urge those who supported my candidacy to take a long and thoughtful look at the remaining Democrats. They're all strong contenders who each in their own way would bring desperately needed change to our country. All I ask is that you make your own independent choice, with the same care and dedication to this country that you honored me during this campaign. At this time I will not endorse any candidate. And all I ask of the candidates is that they do not resort to personal attacks to win the nomination. (APPLAUSE) RICHARDSON: Thank you. Our country and our party deserve better than that. I've said, from the beginning, that we must avoid attacking each other. And I continue to believe that, to this day. The campaign -- this campaign is not about those of us who ran or are still running. It's about the American people. Disagree on policy, but respect the personal privacy and personal integrity of the others running. To do otherwise could result in another four to eight years of more of the same. And that would be the biggest tragedy of all. Now, I'm returning to a job that I love... (APPLAUSE) ... serving a state... (APPLAUSE) ... serving a state that I cherish and doing the work of the people I was elected to serve. And I've always said, I'm the luckiest man I know. I married my high school sweetheart. (APPLAUSE) I live in a place called "The Land of Enchantment (ph)." (LAUGHTER) I have the best job in the world. And I just got to run for president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) And, you know, it doesn't get any better than that. So, the time has come to end my quest and come home, to tackle the challenges before us in New Mexico. Our legislature starts next week. And I intend to put my full efforts behind our number one priority: extending health insurance to every New Mexican by the end of my term. (APPLAUSE) RICHARDSON: So to all New Mexico legislator and citizens who participate in the public process, I have a message: I am back. (APPLAUSE) I will continue my international missions to advance the cause of human rights and democracy. (APPLAUSE) I will enjoy riding my horse again. And I will work hard to make Tom Udall the next U.S. senator from New Mexico. (APPLAUSE) I'd like to finish this afternoon with the most important part; saying an appropriate thank you to all of you who supported this campaign. There's so many of you, thousands of supporters, donors who made my dream your dreams and supported our campaign with your extraordinary efforts. Let me just name a few: Barbara Richards; Ed Romero, finance chair... (APPLAUSE) Dave Conerino (ph), campaign manager... (APPLAUSE) ... Amanda Cooper, deputy campaign manager. (APPLAUSE) ... Mike Stratton, my senior political adviser. (APPLAUSE) ... and all the hundreds of New Mexico Roadrunners who gave their time, their hard work to the campaign. (APPLAUSE) They went to Iowa. They went to New Hampshire. And they persevered. And I won't forget it. Also, to my hard-working campaign staff, thank you. (APPLAUSE) I am optimistic. I am positive about this country and our ability to tackle the great challenges ahead. The last year, I've learned so much. RICHARDSON: But I've learned, most of all, that the people of this country are a sincere and caring people. They're also thoughtful and deadly serious about the choice before them as they consider these candidates. So, it's with an optimistic spirit that I withdraw my candidacy for president today. I believe in the American people and their wisdom to make the right choice in the weeks and months ahead. So, to all of you, gracias. May God bless New Mexico and God bless the United States of America. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)
